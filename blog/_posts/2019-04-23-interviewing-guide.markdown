Things that help create a successful result:
1. Approach – ask clarifying questions around technical questions.  Keep in mind we do not allow code editor’s during these rounds.
2. Optimal Solutions – Don’t forget to clean up edge cases, corner cases and bugs.  If you miss one, the interviewer will provide a hint and they like to see that you can react well to the hint.    
3. Thinking aloud - As you work through your problems give the interviewer insight to your thought process.  
4. Speed – Ideally you will be able to get through 2 technical questions so don’t spend too much time on the first one.

* Ask clarifying questions and explain your thought process as you work through the problems.  Think of your interviewer as a peer, not as a professor giving you an exam.
* Show enthusiasm for some aspect of comp sci or whatever it is about the Software Engineer role that you're passionate about.

## Preparation Resources to Review:
This handy technical coaching video explains what to expect and how to interact during your interview, and this pretty entertaining blog post covers everything from technical prep tips to mental preparation. While you're preparing, the Google CodeJam site is also a great resource for problems to practice coding in a plain word document.

For the initial 45-minute coding interviews, expect ~2 coding questions using a whiteboard (if on-site) or laptop (if remote). You will be tested on core CS fundamentals (theory, algorithms, data structures, recursions, binary tree questions, etc.) and your problem solving/logic skills. When coming up with approaches for the questions, think of an efficient, optimized, bug-free solution in the language you code best in. Prepare questions for your interviewer for the end.

-People generally study 1-2 weeks and practice on a whiteboard or coding competition websites.
-Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer to clarify any ambiguity.
-Take hints from your interviewer to showcase your thought process and problem-solving ability. 
-Generally avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion can be an important step.
-Consider different algorithms and algorithmic techniques (sorting, divide-and-conquer, recursion).
-Think about data structures, particularly the ones used most often (Array, Stack/Queue, Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graph, etc.)
-You may be asked about O memory constraints on the complexity of the algorithm you are writing and its running time - O(N^2) to O(N) etc.
