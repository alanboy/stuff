# New Product Marketing

## The strategic Elements of Product development / Introduction

10 worst products: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2lqRBAXxfc

* Dr. Silver. Inventor of Post-it at 3M.
* Sir James Dyson

Market research tools:
* Creativity sessions
* Tradeoff analyses
* Contept tests
* Voice of the customer
* Alpha and beta testing
* Test markets

Firms with a global innovation culture:
* Procter & gamble
* Apple
* Ikea

Not all new products are planned:
* Microwave ovens
* Aspartame
* ScotchGard fabric protector
* Teflon
* Penicilin
* X-rays
* Dynamite

New Products:
* New to the world products: Inventions that create a whole new market.
* New to the firm products: Take a firm into a category new to it.
* Additions to existing product lines: Line extensions and flankers that flesh out the product line in current markets.
* Improvments and resvisions to existing products (Updates)
* Cost reductions: New products that provide similar performance, but at a lower cost.
* Repositionings: Products that are retargeted for a new use, market or application.

> Top innovatorssuch as inten and Gillette stay focused and committed to innovation as a long-term strategic goal. Without such focus, firms can fall back to "tweaking" existing products.

The strategic Elements of Product development :
* Phase 1: Opportunity identification and selection
* Phase 2: Concept generation
* Phase 3: Concept/Project evaluation
* Phase 4: Development (technical and marketing)
* Phase 5: Launch

Between the phases, there is always go/no-go decission. 

Gates:
* Fuzzy gate: Commonly used. this is a "conditional go".
* Hollow gates: The Go decision is made but **no financial support** is provided.

Third-generation process: A **flexible interpretation** of the basic process, which allows **overlapping** phases and fuzzy gates. This flexibility is important in the development of new to the world products.

Procter & gamble case:
* Situation assessment
* PIC recommended a **strategic focus** on products for the face (?) - other opportunities would not be pursued.
* If already several eye makeup products on the market, they would not immediately launch another. Managemnt called this an "initiative rhythm" for product launch.

# Phase 1: Opportunity Identification and Selection
* Three main streams of activity feed strategic planning for new products:
  * Ongoing marketing planning.
  * Ongoing corporate planning.
  * Special opportunity analysis.
* From these activities, the opportunities identified can be sorted into four categories:
  * An underutilized resource
  * A new resource
  * An external mandate
  * An internal mandate
* The process of creatively recognizing such opportunities is called opportunity identification. Once and opportunity is approved, managers turn to various techniques to guide a new product people in exploiting it. 
* Product innovation charter

## Before you start
* Who are you? What do you do?
* Who are your customers?
* Demographics?
* Behaviour traits?
* What is our core competency?
* How are we growing?
* What do we want to do?
* How much risk are we willing to take?
* Timing into market?

## Identify new opportunities
The process of creatively recognizing such opportunities is called opportunity identification. Once an opportunity is approved, managers turn to various techniques to guide a new product people in exploiting it.

* Product platform planning: Build a platform that little products can come of off or take a platform and make an extension. Example: the car industry. Sony with walkman: the basic structure was the same. Boeing: many configurations for the same similar foundation for each airline.
* Greenfield markets: 
* Social trends: 

Coroporate strenghts provide direction for the team. New products in this firm will:
* Use our fine furniture designers (Herman Miller)
* Gain value by being bottled in our bottling system (Coca-cola)
* Be for babies and only babies (Gerber)
* Be for all sports, not just shoes (Nike)
* Offer genuine value (Lexus)

## The PIC: Why does a firm need a new product strategy?
Set the guidelines. Points where we want to go. Setgs goals and objectives. It's a construct on how to go forward and build new things.
It is the new product team's strategy. It is for Products (not processes). It is for innovation. A document specifying the conditions under which a firm will operate. The PIC is not the process, it's the framework.

* To chart the new products teams direction
* To set the teams goals and objectives.
* To tell the team how it will play the game.

Most firms do have a PIC, even if they don't call it by that name.  The more detailed and specific the PIC, the higher are the firm's innovation rates. The more specific the corporate mission and senior managment direciton is spelled out in the PIC, the better is the performance of the firms new products.

Purposes:
* Focus and integrate team effort
* Permit delegation
* Establish the size and range of the "sandbox"


### Elements of a PIC:
* Business Background
    * Key ideas from the situation analysis; special forces such as managerial dictate, reasons for preparing a new PIC at this time.
    * What is this business about? 
    * Why does it exist? 
    * What problem is it trying to solve?
    * What are your company’s core competencies?
    * What are your advantages in relation to your target market’s needs, wants, and consumption trends?
    * What are your company’s marketing capabilities? 
    * What technology currently exists?
    * What is available in the market? 
* Area of focus
    * At least one clear technology dimmension and one clear market dimension. They must match and have a good potential.
    * Technology and market drivers that (1) fit and (2) have a good potential 
* Goals and Objectives Of New Product (MUST BE MEASURABLE):
    * What the project will accomplish, either shor-term as objectives or longer-term as goals.
    * profit, growth, market, status
    * Short Term
    * Long Term
* Guidelines 
    * Any "rules of the road" requirements imposed by the situation or by upper-management. Innovativeness, order of market entry, time/quality/cost, miscellaneous.
    * Make sure they are specific.
    * Bugdetary limitations.
    * Degrees of innovativeness
      * First to market
      * Adaptive product
      * Imitation (emulation)
    * Timing
        * Fist
        * Quick second
        * Slow
        * Late
    * Miscellaneous
        * Avoidance of competition with certain firms
        * Recognition of weaknesses
        * Patentability
        * Product integrity

### Example of a PIC for iPad
* Background: 
* Focus: Technology strenghts include Apple's OS, hardware, applicationa and services, product design and development skills. Marketing requirements include products on the "cutting edge" that offer seamless integration and high performance, yet are intuitive, simple and fun to use.
* Goals: Revolutionary new products should also be platforms for future products, due to the cost of "really new" product development. New pproducts should occupy the leadership position in the market.
* Special guidelines: Apple aims to be the best, not necessarily the first, in new product categories.
* The result: Apple's first "tablet compter", a revolutionary new product seen by many at the time as the "next big thing" No one table computer had established a dmoninant position yet, so Apple could be the standard bearer with the iPad. The plan for the future was to add capabilities and applications to future iPads.

## Product portfolio
When building a new product, you are not going to build one single product. You want to make sure there is a balance of different types of products:

Objectives of product portfolio development
* Strategic alignment: Mix of products reflects the PIC
* Assessing portfolio value: commercial value of products in pipeline is maximized.
* Project balance: select products that balance the existing product line.
* Number of projects: in line with resource requirements.

Example of a portfolio diagram at a Hewlett-Packard Division
![My helpful screenshot](/assets/images/hp1.png)

Portfolio of product types:
* Disruptive innovation
* Technology upgrade
* Product line extension
* Incremental innovation

Every single innovation does not need to be a break trough innovation.

## Managing breaktrough innovation (new to the world)
* Incubation stage contrains first to market problems
  * Tolerate failure but learn from it.
  * Longer and much more expensive.

* Discovery-driven planning
  * Forecasts and plans evolve as more information becomes available.

## The role of the serial innovator
* Mid-level, technical **employees who think and work differently** and follow their own new products process
* **Critical to firms being able to launch radical innovations**  successfully and repeatedly over a long period of time.
* Challenge: **Identify, manage, and properly reward the serial innovator**.
* Can bridte the gap between technology and market, in iterative fashion.
* Begin by undesrstanding customer problem 
* Oscillate between customer need and technology solution.
* Can also bring **market information** 

> Read: Griffin, Price and Vojak, Serial Innovators: How individuals create and deliver Breaktrough innovations.

Spiral development implies **many iterations** between firm and customer. Useful for new-to-the-world products.

Questions: 
* Products that are inventions and create a whole new market are called:	new-to-the-world products (Correct) | new-to-the-firm products | "flanker" brands | improvised products
* Identify the phase in the new product development process during which the item first acquires finite form.	The concept generation phase | The development phase (Correct) | The launch phase | The concept or project evaluation phase
* In the context of opportunity identification and selection, DuPont's discovery of Surlyn, a material with hundreds of potential uses, would fall under which of the following categories?	An underutilized resource | A new resource (Correct) | An external mandate | An internal mandate
* The _____ comes into play once an opportunity is approved, and managers turn to various techniques to guide new product people in exploiting it.	Concept Novelty Copyright (CNC) | Product Development Mandate (PMC) | Product Innovation Charter (PIC) (Correct) | Concept Ideation Rule (CIR)
* In which of the following phases of the new products process is the first formal type of assessment done on new product concepts with regard to financial, technical, and marketing criteria?	Concept or project evaluation phase (Correct) | Product development phase | Product launch phase | Concept generation phase
* What does the PIC NOT usually contain	Background of the company | Goals or objective for the project | Guildelines - rules of the road including budgetary limits | Key stakeholders and responsibilities (Correct) | Area of focus for new product
When you are evaluating products, what major concept discussed how we address and discuss the risk/reward characteristics of a new product?	Product Portfolio Strategy (Correct) | Market Optimiztion Strategy | Degrees of difficulty | Product Validation Process


# Phase 2: Concept generation
* Create new product ideas, usually called product concepts
* Problem-find-solve approach.
* Concept generation

## Creativity and the product concept

What is the problem we are trying to solve?

> If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on it, I would use the first 55 minutes determining the proper questions to ask. Albert E.

> One doesn't just invent a finished product. An idea, yes, or perhaps a rather complete concept. It is important ot spend enough time on the idea-to-concept-to-product issue.

Roadblocks to creativity
* "Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?"
* "This 'telephone'
* "Everything that can be invented has been invented" C.H. Duell, Commissioner, US Office of Patents

Obstancles to Idea generation
* Group think: We think we are being creative, when in reality we are only coming up with ideas that our group will find acceptable.
* Targeting error: We keep going back to the same simple demographic targets.
* Poor customer knowledge: 
* Complexity: 
* Lack of empathy: These same managers are also well-educated, high-income individuals accustomed to an upscale lifestyle. They may simply not understand the "typical" customer.
* Too many cooks: A small new product team works fine, but large companies especially are prone to internal competition for power and influence.

Barriers to firm creativity:
* Cross-functional diversity: Diversity leads to more creative stimulation but also to problem solving difficulties.
* Allegiance to functional areas: Team members need to have a stake in the team's success, or won't be loyal to the team.
* Social cohesion: 
* Role of top management: Management should encourage the teams to be adventurous.

The role of management in stimulating creativity
* Recognize individuality
* Be tolerant to mistakes
* Be supportive under stress
* Competitive teams
* Idea bank of unused ideas for possible reuse
* Encourage interaction even in how offices are laid out.

Required inputs to the creation process:
* Form
* Benefit/need
* Technology

> Technology permits us to develop a form that provides a benefit.

Some patterns in concept generation:
* Customer need
* Firm develops technology
* Firm envisions form

## A product concept
A product concept is a verbal or prototype statemtn of :
* what is going to be changed
and
* how the customer stands to gain or loose

You need at least two of the three inputs to have a feasible new product concept, and all three to have a new product.

MEthods for generating new product concepts:
* Ready-made   
    * new products employees
    * end users
    * resellers, suppliers, vendors
* Toolkit for user innovation:
* Crowdsourcing as a Creative source
    * Open idea solicitation from customers
    * most likely to generate modest product improvements rather than new-to-the-world products.
* Lead users as a creative source
    * They have the best understanding of the problems faced, and can gain from solutions to these problems.
* Open innovation
    * Accept that "not all the smart people work for us"
    * It is not outsorcing! The external sources are viewed as complementary to internal sources os that innovation can be more efficient.
    * Selecting the best partners is critical

## Finding and Solving Customers’ problems

Problem based concept generation

Probelm analysis: General procedure
* Determine product or activity category for your study.
* Identify heavy users
* Gather set of problems associated with product strategy
* Sort and rank the problems according to severity or importance

Gethering the problems:
* internal records (routine contacts with customers)
* Direct inputs form technical and marketing departments
* Problem analysis with customers (ask them what are the problems with the current product, not what they want)

Typical questions fo problem analysis focus groups

Observation and role playing in problem analysis

Problem analysis in action


## Scenario analysis
Extending vs leaping
* Extending: 
* Dynamic leap scenario: 


Questions:
* According to the lecture/book, which of the following statements is true of creative people?	
    * They usually follow reproductive thinking rather than productive thinking. | They tend to be creative throughout their lives and never become uncreative. (Correct) | Their creativity cannot be measured. | They typically cannot benefit from training.
* In the context of barriers to firm creativity, strong interpersonal ties between team members tend to lead to:
    * information overload. | more innovative ideas. | weak social cohesion. | lack of creative abrasion. (Correct)
* Which of the following statements is true of a focus group?
    * A focus group is designed to yield an exploratory and depth-probing type of discussion. (Correct) | A focus group is often very difficult to set up and is the most expensive method of gathering information. | A focus group makes it difficult for a person to talk about his or her problems when others in the group have already admitted they have problems too. | A focus group, unlike the traditional survey, depends on the power of numbers rather than in-depth discussions.
* With reference to scenario analysis, in _____ studies, the focus is on what changes must be made between now and then if the leap scenario is to come about.
    * dynamic leap (Correct) | exploratory | product function | static leap
* A group ideation technique put forth by Alex Osborn that involves a process where one person presents a thought, another person reacts to it, another person reacts to the reaction, and so on is called _____.
    * crowdsourcing | brainstorming (Correct) | scenario analysis | role playing

## Solving the problem

Principles of brainstorming:
* deferral of judgement
* quantity breeds quality

Rules for a brainstorming session:
* no criticism allowed
* Freewheeling -- the wilder the better
* Nothing should slow the session down.
* Combination and improvement of ideas

Electronic brainstorming:
* Supported by GSS (group support sytems) software.
* can handle larger size groups
* contributions are projected on screen and also recorded

Online communities

## Analytical attribute approaces: Introduction and Perceptual mapping
Basic idea: products are made up of attributes -- a feature product change must involve one or more of these attributes.

Theoretical sequence: feature permits a function which provides a benefit.

* Features: What the product consists of.
* Functions: How a product works. What it does.
* Benefits: How the product provides satisfaction to the user.

Types of gap analysis:
* Determinant gap map: produced from managerial **input/judgement** on products)
* AR (Attribute rating) perceptual gap map: based on attribute **ratings by customers**. You go to customers, and have them evaluate the product.
* OS (Overall similarities) perceptual map: based on overall **similarities rating by customers**. Some things are hard to define, but if you group product based on these rating, you can start figuring out how similar products are from each other.


## Determinant gap map
![My helpful screenshot](/assets/images/determinant.png)


## AR (Attribute rating)
Consumers have ranked this. This how people percieve the product. PErception does not equal reality. 

## OS (Overall similarities)
![My helpful screenshot](/assets/images/OverallSimilarities.png)


## Data reduction using multivariate analysis
* Factor analysis: Reduces the original number of attributes to a smaller number of factors, each containing a set of attributes tha "hang together".
* Cluster analysis: Reduces the original number of respondents to a smaller number of clusters based on their benefits sought, as revealed by their "ideal brand".

All gap mapping is controversial.

> It's aitmed at discovering gaps, not demand. Gaps might exist for a reason.


Questions:
* How are the values in a Determinant Gap Map (as discussed in chapter 6) created?	Manager's judgment call (Correct) | Independent External Group (i.e. Gartner) evaluation | Consumer Likert ratings | Consumer similarity ratings
* What is NOT defined as kind of attributes that you can quantify in analytical attribute techniques?	Feature | Benefit | Function | Failure (Correct)

# Phase 3: Concept/Project evaluation
* Before development work can begin on new ideas, they need to be evaluated, screened, sorted out. Screening or pretechnical evaluation. 
    * Quick looks … to complete discounted cash flows and net present value
* Full-screen
* If the decision is to go ahead, the evaluation turns into project evaluation, where we no longer evaluate the idea, but the plan we propose for capitalizing on that idea.
* Quality Function Deployment (chapter 12)
* Product description or product definition or product protocol:  Means a kind of agreement between the various groups the various groups before the extensive technical work gets under way. The protocol should, to the extent possible, be benefits the new item is to yield, not the features the new item is to have.

Questions:
* What is a Pothole evaluation system?	Everything is tentative - just keep going while revising the plans along the way | Identify the damaging problems and only focus on them in the evaluation (Correct) | Put large hurdles late the process that are firm if not passed | Building criteria that gives clues to the success of your project | Evaluate how many small problems / challenges the project faces before going forward
* What does the A-T-A-R stand for in the ATAR model	Action - Test - Adapt - Repeat | Apple - Tomato - Avocado - Raspberry | Aim - Try - Adapt - Renew | Awareness - Trial - Availability - Repurchase (Correct) | Availability - Test - Activation - Release
* The assumption behind the use of conjoint analysis is that:	a product can be represented as a set or bundle of attributes. (Correct) | the number of items per purchase is a constant to scale market share. | a product is considered as a whole rather than in discrete attributes. | preferences can be observed by testing of many virtual variations of the same basic concept.
* True or False: Respondents in a "conjoint research project" need to consciously understand how they rank product attributes.	True | False (Correct)

# Phase 4: Development
This is the phase during which the item acquires finite form- a tangible good or a specific sequence of resources and activities that will perform an intangible service.  Marketing plan is sketched and gradually fleshed out.
* Resource Preparation: it may need special training, new reward systems, revisions in the firms usual project review system and special permissions.
* The major body of effort: The actual development of:
    * The item or service itself
    * The marketing plan for it
    * A business (or financial) plan 
    * The product (or concept) stream involves industrial design and bench work (goods) or systems design (serivces) , prototypes, product specifications, and so on. It culminates in a product that developers hope is finished: produced, tested, and costed out.
    * Marketing planners are busy making periodic market scans (to keep up with the changes) and making marketing decisions as early …. First strategic, then tactical.
* Comprehensive business analysis: The financial analysis is still not firm, but it is good enough to assure managmeent that ithis project will be worthwhile. The financials will gradualy be tightened during the launch phase, and where the actual Go/No Go point is reached varies.

Questions:
* What tool helps you eliminate many ideas before concept testing even begins?	Concept Envisioning Guide (CEG) | Product Innovation Charter (PIC) (Correct) | Capital Investment Constraint (CIC) | External Market Analysis (EMA)
* What is NOT a stated purpose of concept testing	Design effective marketing material for campaign (Correct) | Identify poor concepts so they can be eliminated | Estimate the sales or trial rate of the product | Develop the idea and make tradeoffs
* True or False - Focus groups are not a great tool to use in concept testing because they are not quantitatively robust	True | False (Correct)
* True or False - A good screening process will eliminate subjective judgement from the evaluation	TRUE | FALSE (Correct)
* The primary purpose of the full screen is to	obtain the information required for developing the product innovation charter. | develop and test a prototype of the product. | finalize the overall marketing plan for the product. | estimate the feasibility of technical and commercial accomplishments. (Correct)
* Star Inc. has restricted its budget for developing new products to $20,000. It automatically vetoes a proposed product if the product scores poorly on the factor of budget during the screening process. This factor is known as a _____ factor.	surrogate | culling (Correct) | groupware | level four fiscal
* Which of the following is an objective of full screening?	To encourage cross-functional communication (Correct) | To generate pro-forma financials | To provide data for the product innovation charter | To add the thoughts of potential users to the set of market data collected

	
# Phase 5: Launch
Launch (or commercialization) has described that time 
Includes last few weeks or months before and after the product is launched.
Manufacturing is doing a gradual scale-up output. 
The critical step is to market test, and managers hope any problems discovered are dixable between dress rehearsal and opening night.  (chapter 18)

Questions:
* In order to calculate the net present value that might be associated with a proposed product, it is necessary to:	create a sales forecast (Correct) | calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) | define the payback period | assess costs
* Which of the following serves as the basis of many simulated test markets?	The cumulative expenditures curve | The risk or payoff matrix | The A-T-A-R model (Correct) | The decay curve
* Which of the following forecasting tools is commonly used for durable goods and is based on the diffusion curve of new products through a population?	The A-T-A-R model | Econometric analysis | Multiple regression analysis | The Bass model (Correct)
* _____ is a technique used by Toyota to get cooperation across functional areas, to speed up integration, and to focus the team.	Wildcatting | The Oobeya Room (Correct) | Preference mapping | The Kaizen technique
* _ has been defined as a complete set of customer wants and needs, expressed in the customer's language, organized the way the customer thinks about, uses and interacts with the product, and prioritized by the cust. in terms of importance and performance.	Target market | Voice of the customer (Correct) | Product positioning | Product Protocol
* Engineering characteristics and customer attributes are part of the _____.	VOC grid | HOQ grid (Correct) | PLC grid | TQM grid
* Question #7  The first general purpose of a product proposal is to:	identify the target audience and the benefits offered to them. (Correct) | specify whether the offering is a tangible product or an intangible service. (Correct) | ensure that all tax payments with regard to the product are paid on time. (Correct) | specify what each department will deliver to the final product that the customer buys. (Correct)




More questions:
Which of the following is true of market-driven innovation?	The main purpose of design in market-driven innovation is to modify the product so that it meets customer expectations. (Correct) | In market-driven innovation, new meanings and new technologies are pushed forth. | In market-driven innovation, design is of primary importance, and it takes on the leadership role. | The main role of design in market-driven innovation is to modify the product so that it can accommodate the performance characteristics.
DarkBerry Inc., a cellphone manufacturer, manufactures products that share common design features that make them unique, yet at the same time familiar. All of DarkBerry's cellphones have a sleek appearance and an elegant design.

## Implementation of strategic plan

The launch cycle

Launch tactic:
* Promotion
    * Advertising
    * Coupons
    * Publicity
    * Sampling
    * Beta test sites
* Sales and distribution
    * Shows/demonstrations
    * Technical support
    * Distribution structure
    * Intensity of coverage
    * Distribution incentives
* Pricing
    * Introductory pricing
    * Price administration
* Product
    * Breadth of assortment
* Timing
    * Product deletion
    * Preannoucing

Preannouncement
* Getting to be popular, and very creatively managed.
* Far from the old days of "tease the public"

Beachhead: 
* Refers to the heavy expenditure needed to overcome slaes inertia ("getting the ball rolling")
* Begins with the annoucement

Launch tming and lean launch:
* Flexible supply chain system allowing the firm to respond rapidly to sales changes
* Lean launch gives the firm flexibility in launch timing.

Postponement, refers to delaying finalization of product form and identity until last possible moment. Two categories:
* Time postponement:
* Form postponement: lock in product design as late as possible.

Lean lauch: Firm needs good information technology system in place to track sales and replenish raw material and inventory.

Copy strategy statement:
* Communications tools used at launch will have certain deliverables.
* The way in which the firm communicates these deliverables to the advertising and promotion creative poeple is the copy strategy statement.
* Typical contents:
    * The market segment targeted
    * The product positioning statement
    * The communications (promotion) mix
    * The major copy points to be communicated.
    * Often stated as attributes (features, functions, benefits) but not limited to these.

Typical examples of copy points:
* "The provider of this insurance policy is the largest in the world"
* "This new line of housewares is now available at target"
* This cellular phone has no geographic limitation"

Motivate distributors:
* Icrease distributors unit value.
* Increase distributors unit margin
* Reduce distributors cost of doing business
* Change distributors attitude totward the line.

Barriers to trial:
* Lack of interest in the claim.
* Comptitive ties.
* Lack of belief in the claim.
* Routines
* Rejecting something negative about product.
* Cost
* Complacency

## Market testing
This is not testing the product or how it lands, its testing what is going on in the market. How well your activities to promote your product are going to work. 

The evaluation of the product together with its marketing plan. 

Product use testing: does this product work as expected.
Market testing: does our launch, do our marketing activities work as we planned.


Two key values obtained from market testing:
* Solid forecasts of dollar and unit sales volume.
* Diagnostic information to allow for revising and refining any aspect of the launch.

IT will tell you if there is anything we can do to tweak the launch of the product.

Decide wether to market test:
* Any special twists on the launch?
* What information is needed?
* Costs
* Nature of marketplace
* Capability of testing methodologies


Types of information that might be lacking:
* Manufactuing process: can we ramp-up from pilot production to full scale easily?
* Vendors and resellers: will they do as they have promised in supporting the launch?
* Servicing infrastructure: adequate?
* Customers: will they buy and use the product as expected?
* Cannibalization: waht will be the extend?

### Methods of market testing
Pseudo Sale:

Speculative Sale: If we make this product available as I have described it, would you buy it?

Simulated test market:
* Create a false buying situation and observe what the customer does.
* Follow-up with customer later to assess likely repeat sales.
* Often used for consumer nondurables.

The test market:
* Several test market cities are selected
* Product is sold into those cities in the regular channels and advertised at representative levels in local media.
* Once used to support the decision whether to launch a product, now more frequently used to determine how best to do so.

Pros and Cons of Test Marketing:
* Advantages:
    * Risk reduction
    * Strategic improvement
* Disadvantages
    * Cost
    * Time (hurt competitive advantage)
    * Competitor can disrupt test market

# Crossing the Chasm

## The innovations
Crossing the chasm introduces two kinds of change: disruptive, (or discontinuous), innovation
gets us to change our behavior or the products we use and sustaining, (or continuous),
innovation entails steady improvements and upgrades to products that don’t make us change
our behavior.

## The high tech markets and the Technology Adoption Life Cycle

The book defines a market as a set of actual or potential customers for a given set of products
or services who have a common set of needs or wants, and who reference each other when
making a buying decision. If two people buy the same product for the same reason but
have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market. This is
extremely useful and it really helps in forming a clear division on our marketing segmentations.
The book goes into huge detail about the characteristics of each market, and some of the most
memorable learnings for me were:

* Innovators/Technology enthusiasts seek out novel technology; it’s like a hobby for them. There aren’t many Innovators, and because they’ll try new things, they are important. Other people see them use new things and feel braver themselves about trying them. Innovators pursue new technology products aggressively.
* Early Adopters/Visionaries are quick to understand the benefits of new technology. Unlike the Innovators, they don’t love technology for its own sake. This group relies on its own intuition and vision to make buying decisions. They are people who find it easy to
imagine, understand, and appreciate the benefits of new technology. organization to buy into that project.  Visionaries are not looking for improvement; they are looking for a fundamental breakthrough. Technology is important only insomuch as it promises to deliver on this dream.
* Visionaries represent an opportunity early in a product’s life cycle to generate a burst of revenue and gain exceptional visibility. The opportunity comes with a price tag—a highly demanding customer who will seek to influence your company’s priorities directly and a high-risk project that could end in disappointment for all.
* Early Majority/Pragmatists are practical-minded consumers. If a product seems useful, this group will try it. The Early Majority are cautious of fads. They want to see well-established references before investing substantially. As individuals, pragmatists held back from using software-as-a-service applications until Salesforce.com made it safe to enter the water. Pragmatists want to buy from proven market leaders because they know that third parties will design supporting products around a market-leading product. That is, market-leading products create an aftermarket that other vendors service. 
* Late Majority/Conservative consumers wait for something to become well established. They don’t feel confident in their ability to deal with technology and often buy from big companies. Members of the late majority are not comfortable with their ability to handle a
technology product. Conservatives like to buy preassembled packages, with everything bundled, at a heavily discounted price. The last thing they want to hear is that the software they just bought doesn’t support the home network they have installed. They want high-tech products
to be like refrigerators—you open the door, the light comes on automatically, your food stays cold, and you don’t have to think about it. The products they understand best are those dedicated to a single function—music, video, email, games. 
* Laggards/Skeptics are those consumers who, for personal and/or economic reasons, are not looking to buy new technology. These people simply don’t want anything to do with new technology, for any of a variety of reasons. The primary function of high-tech marketing in relation to skeptics is to neutralize their influence. One of the favorite arguments of skeptics is that disruptive innovation of
any kind rarely fulfill their promises and almost always come with unintended
consequences.


Moving from one market to the other is filled with dilemmas from which there is no escape
because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions. To illustrate, because of
incompatibilities, early adopters do not make good references for the early majority. And
because of the early majority’s concern not to disrupt their organizations, good references are
critical to their buying decisions. The only suitable reference for an early majority customer, it
turns out, is another member of the early majority, but no upstanding member of the early
majority will buy without first having consulted with several suitable references.
But the point of greatest danger in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the
transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary customers to a mainstream market dominated by a large block of customers. It is all the more dangerous because it typically goes
unrecognized.
The gap between these two markets is in fact so significant as to warrant being called a chasm,
and crossing this chasm must be the primary focus of any long-term high-tech marketing
plan. One of the most important lessons about crossing the chasm is that the task ultimately
requires achieving an unusual degree of company unity during the crossing period.

## Conclusion
Even though many readers think the concepts are not new and that the book rather captured
what had been for them scattered intuitions and rueful learnings and put them into a coherent
set of frameworks that could be used for future decision making, I see the framework as a
discontinuous innovation since it changes the way you interact with hight tech markets.
The classic weaknesses of entrepreneurs—lust after the big score and overconfidence in their
ability to execute within any given time frame is softened by using a prescribed framework like
the technology adoption lifecycle.


# The innovators dilemma

* What is the dilemma in the book? Technology is evolving faster than the market can adapt and utilize the advances | The things that made you a winner in the past will make you a loser in the future (Correct) | Big companies are at a disadvantage to smaller companies | The innovators in corporations are not the ones making the resource allocation decisions
* Who really controls the resources in a company? (according to the book) (two answers)	C-Level Suite | Finance organization | Investors (Correct) | Customers (Correct) | Mid-level managers
* What product did the book focus on as a key illustration of the principles	Computers | Digital Storage (Correct) | Cellular phones | Cars | Publishing industry
* Which of these products is most likely to be described as disruptive?	A technology that is significantly more advanced than any competing product | A technology that does one thing really well | A technology that is specifically designed for the biggest customers | A very cheap product that is not as sophisticated as the market leader (Correct)
* What kind of firm is most likely to create disruptive technologies	Very large companies with considerable resources | Large companies in a very competitive market | Small companies in niche markets (Correct) | Small companies building consumer products


What often causes this lagging behind are two principles of good management taught in business schools: that you should always listen to and respond to the needs of your best customers, and that you should focus investments on those innovations that promise the highest returns. But these two principles, in practice, actually sow the seeds of every successful company's ultimate demise. That's why we call it the innovator's dilemma: doing the right thing is the wrong thing. This dilemma rears its head when a type of innovation that we've termed disruptive technology arises at the low end of the market, in the simplest, most unassuming applications. Explaining this paradox is the purpose of this book.

But this book is not about companies with such weaknesses: It is about well-managed companies that have their competitive antennae up, listen astutely to their customers, invest aggressively in new technologies, and yet still lose market dominance.
Sears was praised as one of the best-managed companies in the world at the very time It let Visa and MasterCard usurp the enormous lead it had established in the use of credit cards In retailing.

Consider this assessment of Digital Equipment, made in 1986: 'Taking on Digital Equipment Corp. these days is like standing in front of a moving train. The $7.6 billion computer maker has been gathering speed while most rivals are stalled in a slump in the computer industry.''

One theme common to all of these failures, however, is that the decisions that led to failure were made when the leaders in question were widely regarded as among the best companies in the world.

An alternative explanation, however, is that these failed firms were as well-run as one could expect a firm managed by mortals to be'but that there is something about the way decisions get made in successful organizations that sows the seeds of eventual failure.
What this implies at a deeper level is that many of what are now widely accepted principles of good management are, in fact, only situationally appropriate. There are times at which it is right not to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins, and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets.

sustaining technologies have In common is that they improve the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued.

Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition than had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use.

**Trajectories of Market Need versus Technology Improvement**
The second element of the failure framework, the observation that technologies can progress faster than market demand, illustrated in Figure 1.1, means that in their efforts to provide better products than their competitors and earn higher prices and margins, suppliers often 'overshoot'' their market: They give customers more than they need or ultimately are willing to pay for. And more importantly, it means that disruptive technologies that may underperform today, relative to what users in the market demand, may be fully performance-competitive in that same market tomorrow.

In other words, the needs of many computer users have increased more slowly than the rate of improvement provided by computer designers.

* Principle #1: Disruptive Technologies versus Rational Investments The last element of the failure framework, the conclusion by established companies that investing aggressively in disruptive technologies is not a rational financial decision for them to make, has three
* Principle #2: Small Markets Don't Solve the Growth Needs of Large Companies Disruptive technologies typically enable new markets to emerge, There is strong evidence showing that companies entering these emerging markets early have significant first-mover advantages over later entrants. And yet, as these companies succeed and grow larger, it becomes progressively more difficult for them to enter the even newer small markets destined to become the large ones of the future.
* Principle #3: Markets that Don't Exist Can't Be Analyzed Companies whose investment processes demand quantification of market sizes and financial returns before they can enter a market get paralyzed or make serious mistakes when faced with disruptive technologies. They demand market data when none exists and make judgments based upon financial projections when neither revenues or costs can, In fact, be known. Using planning and marketing techniques that were developed to manage sustaining technologies in the very different context of disruptive ones is an exercise in flapping wings.
* Principle #4: An Organization's Capabilities Define Its Disabilities An organization's capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes'the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash, and technology into outputs of higher value. The second is in the organization's values, which are the criteria that managers and employees in the organization use when making prioritization decisions.
* Principle #5: Technology Supply May Not Equal Market Demand

The basis of product choice often evolves from functionality to reliability, then to convenience, and, ultimately, to price.
when the best firms succeeded, they did so because they listened responsively to their customers and invested aggressively in the technology, products, and manufacturing capabilities that satisfied their customers' next-generation needs. But, paradoxically, when the best firms subsequently failed, it was for the same reasons'they listened responsively to their customers and invested aggressively in the technology, products, and manufacturing capabilities that satisfied their customers' next-generation needs.

**This is one of the innovator's dilemmas:**
'technology mudslide hypothesis': Coping with the relentless onslaught of technology change was akin to trying to climb a mudslide raging down a hill.

Why were the leading drive makers unable to launch 8-inch drives until it was too late? Clearly, they were technologically capable of producing these drives. Their failure resulted from delay in making the strategic commitment to enter the emerging market in which the 8-inch drives initially could be sold. Interviews with marketing and engineering executives close to these companies suggest that the established 14-inch drive manufacturers were held captive by customers.

Mainframe computer manufacturers did not need an 8-inch drive. In fact, they explicitly did not want it: they wanted drives with increased capacity at a lower cost per megabyte.

The 14-inch drive manufacturers were listening and responding to their established customers.
And their customers'in a way that was not apparent to either the disk drive manufacturers or their computer-making customers'were pulling them along a trajectory of 22 percent capacity growth in a 14-inch platform that would ultimately prove fatal.
Of the four leading 8-inch drive makers'Shugart Associates, Micropolis, Priam, and Quantum'only Micropolis survived to become a significant manufacturer of 5.25-inch drives, and that was accomplished only with Herculean managerial effort,
The Pattern Is Repeated: The Emergence of the 3.5-inch Drive

The 3.5-inch drive was first developed in 1984 by Rodime, a Scottish entrant. Sales of this architecture were not significant,

Nearly all of Conner's first year revenues of $113 million 14 came from Compaq Computer, which had aided Conner's start-up with a $30 million investment. The Conner drives were used primarily in a new application'portable and laptop machines, in addition to 'small footprint' desktop models'

Seagate engineers were not oblivious to the coming of the 3.5-inch architecture. Indeed, in early 1985, less than one year after Rodime introduced the first 3.5-inch drive and two years before Conner Peripherals started shipping its product, Seagate personnel showed working 3.5-inch prototype drives to customers for evaluation. The initiative for the new drives came from Seagate's engineering organization. Opposition to the program came primarily from the marketing organization and Seagate's executive team; they argued that the market wanted higher capacity drives at a lower cost per megabyte and that 3.5-inch drives could never be built at a lower cost per megabyte than 5.25-inch drives.

inch architecture could provide only 20 MB'and at higher costs. 15 In response to lukewarm reviews from customers, Seagate's program manager lowered his 3.5-inch sales estimates, and the firm's executives canceled the program. Their reasoning? The markets for 5.25-inch products were larger, and the sales generated by spending the engineering effort on new 5.25-inch products would create greater revenues for the company than would efforts targeted at new 3.5-inch products. In retrospect, it appears that Seagate executives read the market'at least their own market'very accurately.

Seagate finally began shipping 3.5-inch drives in early 1988'the same year in which the performance trajectory of 3.5-inch drives (shown in Figure 1.7) intersected the trajectory of capacity demanded in desktop computers. By that time, the industry had shipped, cumulatively, nearly $750 million in 3.5-inch products. Interestingly, according to industry observers, as of 1991 almost none of Seagate's 3.5-inch products had been sold to manufacturers of portable/laptop/notebook computers. In other words, Seagate's primary customers were still gem desktop'

The fear of cannibalizing sales of existing products is often cited as a reason why established firms delay the introduction of new technologies.

The introduction of new technology may not be inherently cannibalistic. But when established firms wait until a new technology has become commercially mature in its new applications and launch their own version of the technology only in response to an attack on their home markets, the fear of cannibalization can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It was as if the leading firms were held captive by their customers, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged.

## Value Networks and the Impetus to Innovate

Henderson and Clark, for example, conclude that companies' organizational structures typically facilitate component-level innovations, because most product development organizations consist of subgroups that correspond to a product's components. Such systems work very well as long as the product's fundamental architecture does not require change. But, say the authors, when architectural technology change is required, this type of structure impedes innovations that require people and groups to communicate and work together in new ways.

Tracy Kidder's Pulitzer Prize'winning narrative, The Soul of a New Machine, Data General engineers developing a next-generation minicomputer intended to leapfrog the product position of Digital Equipment Corporation were allowed by a friend of one team member into his facility in the middle of the night to examine Digital's latest computer, which his company had just bought. When Tom West, Data General's project leader and a former long-time Digital employee, removed the cover of the DEC minicomputer and examined its structure, he saw 'Digital's organization chart in the design of the product.' 2 Because an organization's structure and how its groups work together may have been established to facilitate the design of its dominant product, the direction of causality may ultimately reverse itself: The organization's structure and the way its groups learn to work together can then affect the way it can and cannot design new products.

In assessing blame for the failure of good companies, the distinction is sometimes made between innovations requiring very different technological capabilities, that is, so-called radical change, and those that build upon well-practiced technological capabilities, often called incremental innovations.
The research of Tushman, Anderson, and their associates supports Clark's hypothesis. 5 They found that firms failed when a technological change destroyed the value of competencies previously cultivated and succeeded when new technologies enhanced them.

**Value Networks Mirror Product Architecture**
Firms that design and assemble disk drives, for example, such as Quantum and Maxtor, procure read-write heads from firms specializing in the manufacture of those heads, and they buy disks from other firms and spin motors, actuator motors, and integrated circuitry from still others. At the next higher level, firms that design and assemble computers may buy their integrated circuits, terminals, disk drives, IC packaging, and power supplies from various firms that manufacture those particular products. This nested commercial system is a value network.
Sorry, we're unable to display this type of content.

We can use a technique called hedonic regression analysis to identify how markets valued individual attributes
Many scholars have asserted that the essence of strategic technology management is to identify when the point of inflection on the present technology's S-curve has been passed, and to identify and develop whatever successor technology rising from below will eventually supplant the present approach.

We saw, in chapter 1, a stunningly consistent pattern of successful implementation of sustaining innovations by established firms and their failure to deal with disruptive ones. The pattern was consistent because the managerial decisions that led to those outcomes made sense. Good managers do what makes sense, and what makes sense is primarily shaped by their value network.

* Step 1: Disruptive Technologies Were First Developed within Established Firms development was often the work of engineers at established firms, using bootlegged resources.  Rarely initiated by senior management,
* Step 2: Marketing Personnel Then Sought Reactions from Their Lead Customers The engineers then showed their prototypes to marketing personnel, asking whether a market for the smaller, less expensive (and lower performance) drives existed. The marketing organization, using its habitual procedure for testing the market appeal of new drives, showed the prototypes to lead customers of the existing product line, asking them for an evaluation.  IBM showed no interest in Seagate's disruptive 3.5-inch drives. IBM's they needed new drives that would take them further along their established performance trajectory.  Working from such input, senior managers shelved the 3.5-inch drive'just When engineers at Control Data, the leading 14-inch drive maker, were officially chartered to develop CDC's initial 8-inch drives, its customers were looking for an average of 300 MB per computer, whereas CDC's earliest 8-inch drives offered less than 60 MB. The 8-inch project was given low priority, and engineers assigned to its development kept getting pulled off to work on problems with 14-inch drives being designed for more important customers. Similar problems plagued the belated launches of Quantum's and Micropolis's 5.25-inch products. 
* Step 3: Established Firms Step Up the Pace of Sustaining Technological Development
* Step 4: New Companies Were Formed, and Markets for the Disruptive Technologies Were Found by Trial and Error New companies, usually including frustrated engineers from established firms, were formed to exploit the disruptive product architecture.  The founders of the leading 3.5-inch drive maker, Conner Peripherals, were disaffected employees from Seagate and Miniscribe, the two largest 5.25-inch manufacturers. The founders of 8-inch drive maker Micropolis came from Pertec, a 14-inch drive manufacturer, and the founders of Shugart and Quantum defected from Memorex.  The start-ups, however, were as unsuccessful as their former employers in attracting established computer makers to the disruptive architecture. Consequently, they had to find new customers.
* Step 5: The Entrants Moved Upmarket Once the start-ups had discovered an operating base in new markets, they realized that, by adopting sustaining improvements in new component technologies, 20 they could increase the capacity of their drives at a faster rate than their new market required.  They blazed trajectories of 50 percent annual improvement, fixing their sights on the large, established computer markets immediately above them on the performance scale.
* Step 6: Established Firms Belatedly Jumped on the Bandwagon to Defend Their Customer Base When the smaller models began to invade established market segments, the drive makers that had initially controlled those markets took their prototypes off the shelf (where they had been put in Step 3) and introduced them in order to defend their customer base in their own market.

By this time, of course, the new architecture had shed its disruptive character and become fully performance-competitive with the larger drives in the established markets.

Although some established manufacturers were able to defend their market positions through belated introduction of the new architecture, many found that the entrant firms had developed insurmountable advantages in manufacturing cost and design experience, and they eventually withdrew from the market.

Control Data, the 14-inch leader, never captured even a 1 percent share of the minicomputer market. It introduced its 8-inch drives nearly three years after the pioneering start-ups did, and nearly all of its drives were sold to its existing mainframe customers. The popular slogan 'stay close to your customers' appears not always to be robust advice.

In other words, flash memory actually builds upon important competencies that many drive makers have developed. The capabilities viewpoint, therefore, would lead us to expect that disk drive makers may not stumble badly in bringing flash storage technology to the market. More specifically, the viewpoint predicts that those firms with the deepest experience in IC design'Quantum, Seagate, and Western Digital'will bring flash products to market quite readily. Others, which historically outsourced much of their electronic circuit design, may face more of a struggle.

**The Organizational Structure Framework**
Flash technology is what Henderson and Clark would call radical technology. Its product architecture and fundamental technological concept are novel compared to disk drives. The organizational structure viewpoint would predict that, unless they created organizationally independent groups to design flash products, established firms would stumble badly. Seagate and Quantum did, indeed, rely on independent groups and did develop competitive products.

**The Technology S-Curve Framework**

**Insights from the Value Network Framework**
The value network framework asserts that none of the foregoing frameworks is a sufficient predictor of success.
Specifically, even where established firms did not possess the requisite technological skills to develop a new technology, they would marshal the resources to develop or acquire them if their customers demanded it.
There is, in other words, no way to use flash today in the markets where firms such as Quantum and Seagate make their money.
Hence, because flash cards are being used in markets completely different from those Quantum and Seagate typically engage'palmtop computers, electronic clipboards, cash registers, electronic cameras, and so on'the value network framework would predict that firms similar to Quantum and Seagate are not likely to build market-leading positions in flash memory.
This is not because the technology is too difficult or their organizational structures impede effective development, but because their resources will become absorbed in fighting for and defending larger chunks of business in the mainstream disk drive value networks in which they currently make their money.

Indeed, the marketing director for a leading flash card producer observed, 'We're finding that as hard disk drive manufacturers move up to the gigabyte range, they are unable to be cost competitive at the lower capacities. As a result, disk drive makers are pulling out of markets in the 10 to 40 megabyte range and creating a vacuum into which flash can move.'

Beginning shortly after World War II and continuing through the late 1960s, while the dominant source of power remained the diesel engine, a new mechanism emerged for extending and lifting the bucket: hydraulically actuated systems replaced the cable-actuated
systems. Only four of the thirty or so established manufacturers of cable-actuated equipment in business in the 1950s (Insley, Koehring, Little Giant, and Link Belt) had successfully transformed themselves into sustainable hydraulic excavator manufacturers by the 1970s. Most of the others failed.

Bucyrus faced precisely the same problem in marketing its hydraulic backhoe as Seagate had faced with its 3.5-inch drives: Its most powerful mainstream customers had no use for it. By the early 1970s, all of these firms had been driven from the sewer, piping, and general excavation markets by the entrants, most of which had refined their technological capabilities initially in the small-contractor market. Once both technologies were good enough in the basic capabilities demanded, therefore, the basis of product choice in the market shifted to reliability.

Moreover, developing bigger, better, and faster cable excavators to steal share from existing competitors constituted a much more obvious opportunity for profitable growth than did a venture into hydraulic backhoes, given how small the backhoe market was when it appeared in the 1950s. So, as we have seen before, these companies did not fail because the technology wasn't available. They did not fail because they lacked information about hydraulics or how to use it; indeed, the best of them used it as soon as it could help their customers. They did not fail because management was sleepy or arrogant. They failed because hydraulics didn't make sense'until it was too late.

That is, in fact, why disruptive technologies confront innovators with such a dilemma. Working harder, being smarter, investing more aggressively, and listening more astutely to customers are all solutions to the problems posed by new sustaining technologies. But these paradigms of sound management are useless'even counterproductive, in many instances'when dealing with disruptive technology.

## CHAPTER FOUR What Goes Up, Can't Go Down

The two-levels-up manager starts her interrogation: 

- 'Who's going to buy it?' 
- 'Well, there's a whole segment in the workstation industry'they buy over $600 million in drives each year'that we've just never been able to reach because our capacity points just don't reach that high. I think this product just might get us there.' 
- 'Have you run this idea past any potential customers?' 
- 'Yeah, I was in California last week. They all said they wanted prototypes as soon as they could get them. There's a design window opening up in nine months. They've been working with their current supplier [competitor X] to get something ready, but someone we just hired from competitor X said they're having lots of trouble meeting the specs. I really think we can do it.' 
- 'But does engineering think we can do it?' 
- 'They say it'll be a stretch, but you know them. They always say that.' 
- 'What kind of margins are we looking at up there?'
-  'That's what really excites me about this. If we can build it in our current factory, given the price per megabyte competitor X has been getting, I think we can get close to 35 percent.'

Compare that conversation to the manager's interchange with the engineer whose idea is for a cheaper, smaller, slower, lower-capacity disruptive disk drive. 

- 'Who's going to buy it?' 
- 'Well, I'm not sure, but there's got to be a market out there somewhere for it. People are always wanting things smaller and less expensive. I could see them using it in fax machines, printers, maybe.' 
- 'Have you run this idea past any potential customers?' 
- 'Yeah, when I was at the last trade show I sketched the idea out for one of our current customers. He said he was interested, but couldn't see how they could really use it. Today you really need 270 MB to run everything, and there's just no way we could get that kind of capacity on this thing'at least not for a while. His response doesn't surprise me, really.' 
- 'How about the guys who make fax machines? What do they think?'
- 'Well, they say they don't know. Again, it's an intriguing idea, but they already have their product plans pretty well set, and none of them use disk drives.' 
- 'You think we could make money on this project?' 
- 'Well, I think so, but that depends on how we could price it, of course.'

Which of the two projects will the two-levels-up manager back? In the tug-of-war for development resources, projects targeted at the explicit needs of current customers or at the needs of existing users that a supplier has not yet been able to reach will always win over proposals to develop products for markets that do not exist. This is because, in fact, the best resource allocation systems are designed precisely to weed out ideas that are unlikely to find large, profitable, receptive markets. Any company that doesn't have a systematic way of targeting its development resources toward customers' needs, in fact, will fail.

In August 1994, I was visiting the CEO of one of the largest disk drive companies and asked him what his firm was doing about the 1.8-inch drive. This clearly touched a hot button. He pointed to a shelf in his office where a sample 1.8-inch drive was perched. 'You see that?' he demanded. 'That's the fourth generation of 1.8-inch drives we've developed'each one with more capacity than the last. But we haven't sold any. We want to be ready when the market is there, but there just isn't a market for them yet.'

About a month later I was leading a case discussion in the Harvard MBA program's technology and operations management course about the development of a new engine at Honda. One of the students in the class had previously worked in Honda's research and development organization, so I asked him to take a few minutes to tell the class what it was like working there. It turned out that he had been working on dashboard mapping and navigation systems. I couldn't resist interrupting his talk by asking, 'How do you store all that data for the maps?' Said the student: 'We found a little 1.8-inch disk drive and put it in there. It's really neat'almost a solid-state device, with very few moving parts. Really rugged.' 'Who do you buy them from?' I pressed. 'It's kind of funny,' he replied. 'You can't buy them from any of the big disk drive companies. We get them from a little startup company somewhere in Colorado'I can't remember the name.' I have since reflected on why the head of this company would insist so stubbornly that there was no market for 1.8-inch drives, even while there was, and why my student would say the big drive makers didn't sell these drives, even though they were trying.

The answer lies in the northeast-southeast problem, and in the role that the hundreds of well-trained decision makers in a good company play in funneling resources and energy into those projects they perceive will bring the company the greatest growth and profit.

For an organization to accomplish a task as complex as launching a new product, logic, energy, and impetus must all coalesce behind the effort. Hence, it is not just the customers of an established firm that hold it captive to their needs. Established firms are also captive to the financial structure and organizational culture inherent in the value network in which they compete'a captivity that can block any rationale for timely investment in the next wave of disruptive technology.

    Sound managerial decisions are at the very root of their impending fall from industry leadership.

## MANAGING DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE

It was only when confronted with disruptive technology that they failed. There had, therefore, to be a reason why good managers consistently made wrong decisions when faced with disruptive technological change.

The reason is that good management itself was the root cause. Managers played the game the way it was supposed to be played.
Successful companies want their resources to be focused on activities that address customers' needs, that promise higher profits, that are technologically feasible, and that help them play in substantial markets. Yet, to expect the processes that accomplish these things also to do something like nurturing disruptive technologies'to focus resources on proposals that customers reject, that offer lower profit, that underperform existing technologies and can only be sold in insignificant markets'is akin to flapping one's arms with wings strapped to them in an attempt to fly.

There were, in fact, five fundamental principles of organizational nature that managers in the successful firms consistently recognized and harnessed.
These principles are: Resource dependence: Customers effectively control the patterns of resource allocation in well-run companies. Small markets don't solve the growth needs of large companies. The ultimate uses or applications for disruptive technologies are unknowable in advance. Failure is an intrinsic step toward success. Organizations have capabilities that exist independently of the capabilities of the people who work within them. Organizations' capabilities reside in their processes and their values'and the very processes and values that constitute their core capabilities within the current business model also define their disabilities when confronted with disruption. Technology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones that constitute their greatest value in emerging markets.

How did the successful managers harness these principles to their advantage? They embedded projects to develop and commercialize disruptive technologies within an organization whose customers needed them. When managers aligned a disruptive innovation with the 'right' customers, customer demand increased the probability that the innovation would get the resources it needed. They placed projects to develop disruptive technologies in organizations small enough to get excited about small opportunities and small wins. They planned to fail early and inexpensively in the search for the market for a disruptive technology. They found that their markets generally coalesced through an iterative process of trial, learning, and trial again. They utilized some of the resources of the mainstream organization to address the disruption, but they were careful not to leverage its processes and values. They created different ways of working within an organization whose values and cost structure were turned to the disruptive task at hand. When commercializing disruptive technologies, they found or developed new markets that valued the attributes of the disruptive products, rather than search for a technological breakthrough so that the disruptive product could compete as a sustaining technology in mainstream markets.
At a more serious level, the desirability of aligning our actions with the more powerful laws of nature, society, and psychology, in order to lead a productive life, is a central theme in many works, particularly the ancient Chinese classic, Tao te Ching.

Most executives would like to believe that they're in charge of their organizations, that they make the crucial decisions and that when they decide that something should be done everyone snaps to and executes. This chapter expands on the view already introduced: that in practice, it is a company's customers who effectively control what it can and cannot do.

This observation supports a somewhat controversial theory called resource dependence, propounded by a minority of management scholars, 1 which posits that companies' freedom of action is limited to satisfying the needs of those entities outside the firm (customers and investors, primarily) that give it the resources it needs to survive.

The controversy with this theory arises when its proponents conclude that managers are powerless to change the courses of their
firms against the dictates of their customers.

Even if a manager has a bold vision to take her or his company in a very different direction, the power of the customer-focused people and processes in any company well-adapted to survival in its competitive environment will reject the manager's attempts to change direction. Therefore,
Resource dependence theorists conclude that the real role of managers in companies whose people and systems are well-adapted to survival is, therefore, only a symbolic one.

What, then, should managers do when faced with a disruptive technology that the company's customers explicitly do not want? One option is to convince everyone in the firm that the company should pursue it anyway, that it has long-term strategic importance despite rejection by the customers who pay the bills and despite lower profitability than the upmarket alternatives. The other option would be to create an independent organization and embed it among emerging customers that do need the technology. Which works best?

The cases presented in this chapter provide strong evidence that the second option offers far higher probabilities of success than the first.

## INNOVATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION

It is through these mechanisms of seeking corporate profit and personal success, therefore, that customers exert a profound influence on the process of resource allocation, and hence on the patterns of innovation, in most companies.

In 1984 several Quantum employees saw a potential market for a thin 3.5-inch drive plugged into an expansion slot in IBM XT-and AT-class desktop computers'drives that would be sold to personal computer users rather than the OEM minicomputer manufacturers that had accounted for all of Quantum's revenue. They determined to leave Quantum and start a new firm to commercialize their idea. Rather than let them leave unencumbered, however, Quantum's executives financed and retained 80 percent ownership of this spinoff venture, called Plus Development Corporation, and set the company up in different facilities. It was a completely self-sufficient organization, with its own executive staff and all of the functional capabilities required in an independent company. Plus was extremely successful. It designed and marketed its drives but had them manufactured under contract by Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics (MKE) in Japan.

As sales of Quantum's line of 8-inch drives began to evaporate in the mid-1980s, they were offset by Plus's growing 'Hardcard' revenues. By 1987, sales of Quantum's 8-and 5.25-inch products had largely disappeared. Quantum then purchased the remaining 20 percent of Plus, essentially closed down the old corporation, and installed Plus's executives in Quantum's most senior positions. They then reconfigured Plus's 3.5-inch products to appeal to OEM desktop computer makers, such as Apple, just as the capacity vector for 3.5-inch drives was invading the desktop market, as shown in the disk drive trajectory map in Figure 1.7. Quantum, thus reconstituted as a 3.5-inch drive maker, has aggressively adopted sustaining component technology innovations, moving upmarket toward engineering workstations, and has also successfully negotiated the sustaining architectural innovation into 2.5-inch drives. By 1994 the new Quantum had become the largest unit-volume producer of disk drives in the world. 5
Sorry, were unable to display this type of content.

By analogy, this is what Quantum and Control Data did. By embedding independent organizations within an entirely different value network, where they were dependent upon the appropriate set of customers for survival, those managers harnessed the powerful forces of resource dependence.
Just as in disk drives and excavators, a few of the leading traditional retailersnotably S. S. Kresge, F. W. Woolworth, and Dayton Hudson saw the disruptive approach coming and invested early. None of the other major retail chains, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, J. C. Penney, and R. H. Macy, made a significant attempt to create a business in discount retailing. Kresge (with its Kmart chain) and Dayton Hudson (with the Target chain) succeeded.

They both created focused discount retailing organizations that were independent from their traditional business. They recognized and harnessed the forces of resource dependence. By contrast, Woolworth failed in its venture (Woolco), trying to launch it from within the F. W. Woolworth variety store company. 

What was the impact of this cost-saving consolidation? It provided more evidence that two models for how to make money cannot peacefully coexist within a single organization.

Although it was never framed as such in the debates of the time, inkjet printing was a disruptive technology. It was slower than the laser jet, its resolution was worse, and its cost per printed page was higher. But the printer itself was smaller and potentially much less expensive than the laser jet. At these lower prices, it promised lower gross margin dollars per unit than the laser jet. Thus, the ink-jet printer was a classic disruptive product, relative to the laser jet business.

Rather than place its bet exclusively with one or the other, and rather than attempt to commercialize the disruptive ink-jet from within the existing printer division in Boise, Idaho, HP created a completely autonomous organizational unit, located in Vancouver, Washington, with responsibility for making the ink-jet printer a success. It then let the two businesses compete against each other. Each has behaved classically.
The ink-jet printer isnt as good as the laser jet and may never be. But the critical question is whether the ink jet could ever be as good a printer as the personal desktop computing market demands. The answer appears to be yes.
HPs ink-jet printer business is now capturing many of those who would formerly have been laser jet users. Ultimately, the number of users at the highest-performance end of the market, toward which the laser jet division is headed, will probably become small. One of HPs businesses may, in the end, have killed another.

But had HP not set up its ink-jet business as a separate organization, the ink-jet technology would probably have languished within the mainstream laser jet business, leaving one of the other companies now actively competing in the ink-jet printer business, such as Canon, as a serious threat to HPs printer business.

the most straightforward way of confronting this difficulty is to implant projects aimed at commercializing disruptive technologies in organizations small enough to get excited about small-market opportunities, and to do so on a regular basis even while the mainstream company is growing.

**ARE THE PIONEERS REALLY THE ONES WITH ARROWS IN THEIR BACKS?**
A crucial strategic decision in the management of innovation is whether it is important to be a leader or acceptable to be a follower.
You can always tell who the pioneers were, an old management adage goes. Theyre the ones with the arrows in their backs.'
As with most disagreements in management theory, neither position is always right.

**Leadership in Disruptive Technologies Creates Enormous Value**
In contrast to the evidence that leadership in sustaining technologies has historically conferred little advantage on the pioneering disk drive firms, there is strong evidence that leadership in disruptive technology has been very important.

The companies that entered the new value networks enabled by disruptive generations of disk drives within the first two years after those drives appeared were six times more likely to succeed than those that entered later.

Whether a firm was a start-up or a diversified firm had little impact on its success rate. What mattered appears not to have been its organizational form, but whether it was a leader in introducing disruptive products and creating the markets in which they were sold.

The firms that led in launching disruptive products together logged a cumulative total of $62 billion dollars in revenues between 1976 and 1994.
Those that followed into the markets later, after those markets had become established, logged only $3.3 billion in total revenue.
It is, indeed, an innovator's dilemma. Firms that sought growth by entering small, emerging markets logged twenty times the revenues of the firms pursuing growth in larger markets.

How can a manager of a large, successful company deal with these realities of size and growth when confronted by disruptive change? I have observed three approaches in my study of this problem: Try to affect the growth rate of the emerging market, so that it becomes big enough, fast enough, to make a meaningful dent on the trajectory of profit and revenue growth of a large company. Wait until the market has emerged and become better defined, and then enter after it 'has become large enough to be interesting.' Place responsibility to commercialize disruptive technologies in organizations small enough that their performance will be meaningfully affected by the revenues, profits, and small orders flowing from the disruptive business in its earliest years. As the following case studies show, the first two approaches are fraught with problems. The third has its share of drawbacks too, but offers more evidence of promise.

In launching the Newton, however, Apple was desperate to short-circuit this coalescent process for defining the ultimate product and market. It assumed that its customers knew what they wanted and spent very aggressively to find out what this was. (As the next chapter will show, this is impossible.) Then to give customers what they thought they wanted, Apple had to assume the precarious role of a sustaining technology leader in an emerging industry.

Because emerging markets are small by definition, the organizations competing in them must be able to become profitable at small scale.

The executives' actions were a symptom of a deeper problem: Small markets cannot satisfy the near-term growth requirements of big organizations.

* CASE STUDY: WAITING UNTIL A MARKET IS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTING. A second way that many large companies have responded to the disruptive technology trap is to wait for emerging markets to 'get large enough to be interesting' before they enter.
* CASE STUDY: GIVING SMALL OPPORTUNITIES TO SMALL ORGANIZATIONS Every innovation is difficult. That difficulty is compounded immeasurably, however, when a project is embedded in an organization in which most people are continually questioning why the project is being done at all. Executives can give an enormous boost to a project's probability of success, therefore, when they ensure that it is being executed in an environment in which everyone involved views the endeavor as crucial to the organization's future growth and profitability. This can be done either by spinning out an independent organization or by acquiring an appropriately small company. Expecting achievement-driven employees in a large organization to devote a critical mass of resources, attention, and energy to a disruptive project targeted at a small and poorly defined market is equivalent to flapping one's arms in an effort to fly: It denies an important tendency in the way organizations work.
* Another way of matching the size of an organization to the size of the opportunity is to acquire a small company within which to incubate the disruptive technology. This is how Allen Bradley negotiated its very successful disruptive transition from mechanical to electronic motor controls.

SUMMARY: This recommendation is not new, of course; a host of other management scholars have also argued that smallness and independence confer certain advantages in innovation. It is my hope that chapters 5 and 6 provide deeper insight about why and under what circumstances this strategy is appropriate.

## CHAPTER SEVEN Discovering New and Emerging Markets

Markets that do not exist cannot be analyzed: Suppliers and customers must discover them together.

The strategies and plans that managers formulate for confronting disruptive technological change, therefore, should be plans for learning and discovery rather than plans for execution. This is an important point to understand, because managers who believe they know a market's future will plan and invest very differently from those who recognize the uncertainties of a developing market.

Most managers learn about innovation in a sustaining technology context because most technologies developed by established companies are sustaining in character. Such innovations are, by definition, targeted at known markets in which customer needs are understood.

What this means, however, is that much of what the best executives in successful companies have learned about managing innovation is not relevant to disruptive technologies.

Most marketers, for example, have been schooled extensively, at universities and on the job, in the important art of listening to their customers, but few have any theoretical or practical training in how to discover markets that do not yet exist.

The Disk/Trend staff used the same methods to generate the forecasts for sustaining architectures as they did for disruptive ones: interviewing leading customers and industry experts, trend analysis, economic modeling, and so on. The techniques that worked so extraordinarily well when applied to sustaining technologies, however, clearly failed badly when applied to markets or applications that did not yet exist.

HONDA'S INVASION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE INDUSTRY
Note:Omg

Honda's success in attacking and dominating the North American and European motorcycle markets has been cited as a superb example of clear strategic thinking coupled with aggressive and coherent execution.

During Japan's years of post-war reconstruction and poverty, Honda had emerged as a supplier of small, rugged motorized bicycles that were used by distributors and retailers in congested urban areas to make small deliveries to local customers.

The reaction of some managers to the difficulty of correctly planning the markets for disruptive technologies is to work harder and plan smarter. While this approach works for sustaining innovations, it denies the evidence about the nature of disruptive ones. Amid all the uncertainty surrounding disruptive technologies, managers can always count on one anchor: Experts' forecasts will always be wrong. It is simply impossible to predict with any useful degree of precision how disruptive products will be used or how large their markets will be. An important corollary is that, because markets for disruptive technologies are unpredictable, companies' initial strategies for entering these markets will generally be wrong.

### Failed Ideas versus Failed Businesses

Research has shown, in fact, that the vast majority of successful new business ventures abandoned their original business strategies when they began implementing their initial plans and learned what would and would not work in the market. 9
The dominant difference between successful ventures and failed ones, generally, is not the astuteness of their original strategy. Guessing the right strategy at the outset isn't nearly as important to success as conserving enough resources (or having the relationships with trusting backers or investors) so that new business initiatives get a second or third stab at getting it right. Those that run out of resources or credibility before they can iterate toward a viable strategy are the ones that fail.

### Failed Ideas and Failed Managers

In most companies, however, individual managers don't have the luxury of surviving a string of trials and errors in pursuit of the strategy that works. Rightly or wrongly, individual managers in most organizations believe that they cannot fail: If they champion a project that fails because the initial marketing plan was wrong, it will constitute a blotch on their track record, blocking their rise through the organization. Because failure is intrinsic to the process of finding new markets for disruptive technologies, the inability or unwillingness of individual managers to put their careers at risk acts as a powerful deterrent to the movement of established firms into the value networks created by those technologies. As Joseph Bower observed in his classic study of the resource allocation process at a major chemical company, 'Pressure from the market reduces both the probability and the cost of being wrong.

### Plans to Learn versus Plans to Execute

In general, for sustaining technologies, plans must be made before action is taken, forecasts can be accurate, and customer inputs can be reasonably reliable. Careful planning, followed by aggressive execution, is the right formula for success in sustaining technology. But in disruptive situations, action must be taken before careful plans are made. 

Because much less can be known about what markets need or how large they can become, plans must serve a very different purpose: They must be plans for learning rather than plans for implementation. Discovery-driven planning, which requires managers to identify the assumptions upon which their business plans or aspirations are based, works well in addressing disruptive technologies.

Philosophies such as management by objective and management by exception often impede the discovery of new markets because of where they focus management attention.

Such discoveries often come by watching how people use products, rather than by listening to what they say.
I have come to call this approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, by which I mean marketing under an explicit assumption that no one'not us, not our customers'can know whether, how, or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used before they have experience using it.

## How to Appraise Your Organization's Capabilities and Disabilities
When managers assign employees to tackle a critical innovation, they instinctively work to match the requirements of the job with the capabilities of the individuals whom they charge to do it. In evaluating whether an employee is capable of successfully executing a job, managers will assess whether he or she has the requisite knowledge, judgment, skill, perspective, and energy. Managers will also assess the employee's values'the criteria by which he or she tends to decide what should and shouldn't be done. Indeed, the hallmark of a great manager is the ability to identify the right person for the right job, and to train his or her employees so that they have the capabilities to succeed at the jobs they are given.
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the theory that lies behind the empirical observations made in chapters 5, 6, and 7'in particular, the observation that the only companies that succeeded in addressing disruptive technology were those that created independent organizations whose size matched the size of the opportunity.


## AN ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES FRAMEWORK

    Three classes of factors affect what an organization can and cannot do: its resources, its processes, and its values.

Resources include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually things, or assets'they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or enhanced.
Organizations create value as employees transform inputs of resources' people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, energy, and cash'into products and services of greater worth. The patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision-making through which they accomplish these transformations are processes. 3 Processes include not just manufacturing processes, but those by which product development, procurement, market research, budgeting, planning, employee development and compensation, and resource allocation are accomplished.

One of the dilemmas of management is that, by their very nature, processes are established so that employees perform recurrent tasks in a consistent way, time after time. To ensure consistency, they are meant not to change'or if they must change, to change through tightly controlled procedures. This means that the very mechanisms through which organizations create value are intrinsically inimical to change.
The values of an organization are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made.

Some corporate values are ethical in tone, such as those that guide decisions to ensure patient well-being at Johnson & Johnson or that guide decisions about plant safety at Alcoa.

But within the Resources-Processes-Values (RPV) framework, values have a broader meaning. An organization's values are the standards by which employees make prioritization decisions'by they judge whether an order is attractive or unattractive; whether a customer is more important or less important; whether an idea for a new product is attractive or marginal; and so on.

A key metric of good management, in fact, is whether such clear and consistent values have permeated the organization.

## THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESSES AND VALUES, AND SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING SUSTAINING VS. DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES

In fact, one reason that many soaring young companies flame out after they go public based upon a hot initial product is that whereas their initial success was grounded in resources' the founding group of engineers'they fail to create processes that can create a sequence of hot products.
In contrast, at highly successful firms such as McKinsey and Company, the processes and values have become so powerful that it almost doesn't matter which people get assigned to which project teams. Hundreds of new MBAs join the firm every year, and almost as many leave. But the company is able to crank out high-quality work year after year because its core capabilities are rooted in its processes and values rather than in its resources. I sense, however, that these capabilities of McKinsey also constitute its disabilities. The rigorously analytical, data-driven processes that help it create value for its clients in existing, relatively stable markets render it much less capable of building a strong client base among the rapidly growing companies in dynamic technology markets.

Once members of the organization begin to adopt ways of working and criteria for making decisions by assumption, rather than by conscious decision, then those processes and values come to constitute the organization's culture.

Culture enables employees to act autonomously and causes them to act consistently. Hence, the location of the most powerful factors that define the capabilities and disabilities of organizations migrates over time 'from resources toward visible, conscious processes and values, and then toward culture.

Despite beliefs spawned by popular change-management and reengineering programs, processes are not nearly as flexible or 'trainable' as are resources'and values are even less so.

For these reasons, managers who determine that an organization's capabilities aren't suited for a new task, are faced with three options through which to create new capabilities. They can: Acquire a different organization whose processes and values are a close match with the new task Try to change the processes and values of the current organization Separate out an independent organization and develop within it the new processes and values that are required to solve the new problem. Unfortunately, processes are very hard to change'for two reasons. The first is that organizational boundaries are often drawn to facilitate the operation of present processes.

The second reason new process capabilities are hard to develop is that, in some cases, managers don't want to throw the existing processes out'the
separate organization is required when the mainstream organization's values would render it incapable of focusing resources on the innovation project.

## Performance Provided, Market Demand, and the Product Life Cycle

**WHEN DOES A PRODUCT BECOME A COMMODITY?**

The process of commoditization of disk drives was defined by the interplay between the trajectories of what the market demanded and what the technology supplied.

* 1. The Weaknesses of Disruptive Technologies Are Their Strengths
* 2. Disruptive Technologies Are Typically Simpler, Cheaper, and More Reliable and Convenient than Established Technologies

## PERFORMANCE OVERSUPPLY IN THE ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE MARKET

* First, the pace of progress that markets demand or can absorb may be different from the progress offered by technology. This means that products that do not appear to be useful to our customers today (that is, disruptive technologies) may squarely address their needs tomorrow.
* Second, managing innovation mirrors the resource allocation process: Innovation proposals that get the funding and manpower they require may succeed;
* Third, just as there is a resource allocation side to every innovation problem, matching the market to the technology is another.
* Historically, the more successful approach has been to find a new market that values the current characteristics of the disruptive technology. Disruptive technology should be framed as a marketing challenge, not a technological one.
* Fifth, in many instances, the information required to make large and decisive investments in the face of disruptive technology simply does not exist. It needs to be created through fast, inexpensive, and flexible forays into the market and the product.
* Sixth, it is not wise to adopt a blanket technology strategy to be always a leader or always a follower. Companies need to take distinctly different postures depending on whether they are addressing a disruptive or a sustaining technology.
* Seventh. Perhaps the most powerful protection that small entrant firms enjoy as they build the emerging markets for disruptive technologies is that they are doing something that it simply does not make sense for the established leaders to do.
