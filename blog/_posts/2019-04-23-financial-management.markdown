How do you calculate a return?


* Accounting = Actual data
* Finance = Forecasting


# Risk

Sock fund
Bond fund


## Systematic risk
Cannot be diversifie. Economy, inflation, interest rates, etc..

## Un systematic risk (non systmatic)
RYou can diversify. Risk factors affect a limite number of assets.
Inlucdes labor strikes, part shortages.

Total risk
 * systematic
 * unsystematic

Total risk = systematic risk + nonsystematic risk

Beta = systematic risk

Regression

Compare security returns vs return on market.
Slide

Slope = Beta = How much does your security responds to the market.
alpha = the better the manager in terms of producing return



Microsoft has a huge treasury department.

## Single factor pricing model

Expected return on a security (extrememly important)

Forecasting the return on the stick

CAPM (7 start)
Expected return on an individual security:

    Ri = Rf + Bi x (Rm - Rf)

Rf = Risk free rate, like treasury bond.
B of the secuirty
Market risk premium (Rm - Rf)

Treasury bill backed by the government.

Rm = market return , s&p 500 for the last 80 years... ~ 9%
Rf = Risk free rate

This is equal to risk premium

Microsoft Beta ~ 1.0

This means that this stock moves with the market.

Beta is the measure of systematic risk. You cannot get rid of this risk

A beta of 2 means the stock is more volatile.

Less than 1 means its less risky that is less

Vangard is known for index.

How do you value a stock.

Problem #1 in homework.

Stock, present value, of the future cash flows.

Div = Divident

All dividends divided by

### Constant growth model ###

    p0 = Div1 / (R-g) <--- for homework 1


* p0 = current price
* Dev1 = next years dividend (either given, or calculated)
* R =
* g = growth rate of the company

Slide 7


Risk free rate, can be a ten year treasure bond. If not given we can use treasure bond.

Ri = 8.27 %

## Bonds and bond valuation

Coupon
Face value

Junk bond

Most bonds pay twice a year.

Issue maturity

WAC

PVC

The weighted Average - Cost of capital


Measure of the risk of the bond.

When company has equity

Equity is common stock
Debt is bond


## Computing Yield to maturity.

 * N number of periods
 * PV present value, bond price
 * PMT payment, cupon payment for bond
 * FV face value

## Market efficiency

Foundations of market efficiency
* Investor rationality
* Independence of events
* Arbitrage

You and I are rational. 

Shorting the stock: Borring money to buy stock. Betting the stock will go down. Consider cost of borrowing (sometimes 15%).

### Types of efficiency

* Weak form: Technical analysis is useless.
* Semistrong form: Fudamental analysis. Fundamental research. Srubbing the income statemnts, public information, data, yahoo finance, conference call.  High-frequency traders. People that use computers to trade the markets.
* Strong form: Security prices reflect all information- public and private.

Martha Stewart insider trading ?

Blackout period/window. Close to earning report. 

10b51 program. If you are on a board, you can sell automatically.

## The behavioral challenge

Loss aversion bias

Loss aversion risk

Risk premium is high, you want to hold on your investments. I'm not going to sell it, im going to keep it until i make my money back.

Efficient meaning you cannot beat the market on a consistent basis.

## Capital structure

How much cash does Apple have right ? 130 billion dollars in cash. 

Capitalization of the company
Value (V) = Bond (B) + Stock (S)

Financial leverage, EPS, AND ROE

The higher ROE the better. Debt can increase your ROE. 

### MM Proposition I (No taxes)

Vl = Vu

Leverage, unleavered

### MM Proposition II (No taxes)

`Rs = R0 + (B/S) (R0 - RB)`

MM proposition I & II (with taxes)

`VL = Vu + Tc * B`

Unleavered equity means 



Total Cash flow to investors

Cap structure

* Government

* Employees, pension plan
* Suplliers, vendors
* Senior debt holders
* Junior
* Preferred
* Common stock holders
