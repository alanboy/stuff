great delivery company.

is our pizza good enough. no.

you can use negative comments to let you down or use them to excite you.

our pizza had to be significantly better than both of our two main competitors

The problem
Customers did not like the pizza. Marketing metrics showed that Domino's Pizza was viewed as a great delivery company. The goal was to be a great pizza company.

The solution
use customer insights to create entirely new pizza and brand image. It began a two year program to reinvent its brand.

Experimental design.

Marketing metrics is the set of measures that helps marketers quantiry, compare, and interpret their performance.


Domino's Pizza produced a series of ads based on telling consumers the truth  about the old Pizza formulation and what changed. The company returned to the focus group that harshly criticized the old product and surprised them with the new and improved pizza.
"Oh yes we did."


First act of the play: "Tell people the truth."

Second act: "Bring the new pizza to those who didn't like it.

The honesty and transparency that the ads pushed, resulted in them being picked up and discussed in a variety of secondary media srouces, resulting in free media. "Second media plan" = Media you don't pay for.

Frederick Herzberg developed a two-factor theory that distinguishes *dissatisfiers* from *satisfiers*. The absence of dissatisfiers is not enough to motivate a purchase.
