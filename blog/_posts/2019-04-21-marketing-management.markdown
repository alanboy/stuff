Work backwards.

Amazon starts with press release + FAQ and works backwards to creat the product (MVP), then collects feedback.

Phylosophy of innovation:
* Who they hire
* How the organize (no big teams)
* Use AWS
* Institutional: yes!
* How to think about business opportunities: How BIG is this market? (Not asking what is the ROI first!)
* Willing to fail

Re. business opportunities. Jeff (Amazon CEO) said, "we fully expect to have a $5b failure in the next 5 years".

**Digital transformation**
* 40% of the work is structured (ERP, CRM, HCM, ITSM-ticketing, SCM)
* 60% of the work is unstructured or dynamic (brand launches, event planning, employee onboarding, parts ordering, invoice tracking)

How -> Who? (Everyone)

Notes:
* Start with the customer and work backwards
* Focus on solutions, not features
* Design meaningful differentiation
* Be opinionantes and adaptable
* Validate with **REAL** customers before you build
* Ownership == Execution (single threaded ownership)


### Dominos Pizza 

great delivery company.

is our pizza good enough. no.

you can use negative comments to let you down or use them to excite you.

our pizza had to be significantly better than both of our two main competitors

**The problem**
Customers did not like the pizza. Marketing metrics showed that Domino's Pizza was viewed as a great delivery company. The goal was to be a great pizza company.

**The solution**
Use customer insights to create entirely new pizza and brand image. It began a two year program to reinvent its brand.

**Experimental design.**
Marketing metrics is the set of measures that helps marketers quantiry, compare, and interpret their performance.

Domino's Pizza produced a series of ads based on telling consumers the truth  about the old Pizza formulation and what changed. The company returned to the focus group that harshly criticized the old product and surprised them with the new and improved pizza.
"Oh yes we did."

First act of the play: "Tell people the truth."

Second act: "Bring the new pizza to those who didn't like it.

The honesty and transparency that the ads pushed, resulted in them being picked up and discussed in a variety of secondary media srouces, resulting in free media. "Second media plan" = Media you don't pay for.


## Buyer/Consumer Behavior

Of these, the cultural factors exert the broadest and deepest influence.

* Cultural factors
* Social Factors
 * Reference groups
    Primary (family friends neighbors, coworkers)
    Secondary (religious, professional, trade-union)
    Aspirational groups are a person hopes to join. People are also influenced by groups to which they don't belong.
    Dissociative groups are those whose values or behavior an individual rejects.
 * Cliques: Small groups whose members interact frequently. They are sometimes insulated from new ideas.
 * Family: Family members constitute the most influential primary reference group.
    - Family of orientation. Parents and siblings. From parents a person acquires an orientation toward religion, politics, economics a sense of personal ambition, self-worth and love.
    **Family of procreation**: Spouse and children. For expensive products and services such as cars, vacations, housing.
    **Roles and status: Family, clubs, organizations, these are often an important source of information and help define norms of behavior. A role consists of the activities a person is expected to perform. Each role in turn connotes a status.
* Personal Factors
 * Age and stage in the life cycle
 * Occupation and Economic Circumstances
 * Personality and self-concept: Brand personality
 * Lifestyle and values

Brand personality: specific mix of human traits that we can attribute to a particular brand. Consumers ofter choose and use brands with personality that is consistent with their actual self-concept (how we view ourselves).

Lifestyle: Is a persons pattern of living in the world as expressed in activities, interests and opinions.

Perception is the process by which we select, organize, and interpret information inputs to create a meaningful picture of the world.

### Psychological processes


Marketing and environmental stimuli enter the consumer's consciousness, and a number of psychological processes combine with certain consumer characteristics to result in the decision processes and purchase decisions. Four key psychological processeslong motivation, perception, learning, and memorylong fundamentally influence consumer responses

Consumer responses are influenced by five key major psychological processes:

* Motivation, can be Biogenic. It arises from physiological states: hunger, thirst, discomfort.
* Perception
* Learning
* Emotions
* Memory


A **need** becomes a **motive** when it is aroused to a sufficient level of intensity to drive us to **act**.

Sigmund Freud assumed the psychological forces shaping people's behavior are largely unconscious and that people cannot fully understand their own motivations.

Abraham Maslow south to explain why people are driven by particular needs at particular times. Human needs are arranged in hierarchy from most to least pressing: physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization needs.

Frederick Herzberg developed a two-factor theory that distinguishes *dissatisfiers* from *satisfiers*. The absence of dissatisfiers is not enough to motivate a purchase.


Selective attention:

### Consumer buying process

The stage? model, which outlines the stages of the? consumer-decision process, is composed of five stages. These are problem? recognition, information? search, evaluation of? alternatives, purchase? decision, and? post-purchase behavior.

* Problem Recognition
 * General Need Description and Product Specification
 * Supplier Search
 * Proposal Solicitation
 * Supplier Selection
 * Order-Routine Specification
 * Performance Review
* Information search
* Evaluation of alternatives
* Purchase decision
* Postpurchase behaviour

### Behavioral Decision Theory and Behavioral Economics

BDT has identified many situations in which consumers make seemingly irrational choices.

Decision heuristics
Framing: Mental accounting

### Total Customer Satisfaction
In general, satisfaction is a personâs feelings of pleasure or disappointment that result from comparing a product or serviceâs perceived performance (or outcome) to expectations.

Marketing is ultimately the art of attracting and keeping profitable customers. The case for maximizing? long-term customer profitability is captured in the concept of?
 The case for maximizing? long-term customer profitability is captured in the concept of customer lifetime value. It describes the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over the? customer's lifetime purchases.
Customer lifetime value (CLV) describes the net present value of the stream of future profits expected over the customerâs lifetime purchases

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value

There are five key ways a company can use and maximize database? marketing: identifying? prospects, segmenting? customers, deepening customer? loyalty, reactivating customer? purchases, and avoiding customer mistakes.

### Business and consumer makets
Consumers are better educated and better informed than? ever, and they have the tools to verify? companies' claims and seek out superior alternatives.?
Customer-perceived value is the difference between the prospective? customer's evaluation of all the benefits and all the costs of an offering and the perceived alternatives.? Customer-perceived value is not something that can be tracked this way.

The business market consists of all organizations that acquire goods and services used in the production of other products or services that are? sold, rented, or supplied to others. The consumer market consists of all organizations that buy or acquire finished products and services.

Business marketing is highly competitive. One of the most critical and fundamental steps in? business-to-business marketing is to create and communicate relevant differentiation from competitors. One of the ways commoditization can be avoided is to differentiate and convince target markets that your product or service is different.

### Business Buying Situations
* Straight rebuy
* Modified buy
* New task

Unilever
168,00 employees
170 countries

Glocal.. global and local combine.

Balancing standarization with customization, while it can be tempting to use the same (global) stategy everywhere, localizing has produced succesful results.

BOP = bottom of the pyramid = developing countries
poorest section of the population. often less than $2,000 us dollars per year.

BOP pays high prices for daily necesities. contributing to the cyclical nature of their poverty.

Unilever is re-targetting to BOP. They hire locals to assist in developing products, services and distribution, and othe infrastructure and improve economic conditions and the lives of the consumers.

Firm can play a substantial role in addressing global poverty.

Unilever pioneered serving the locals by providng to the local sensitivities.

## Segmentation, Targetting & Positioning

Define these:
A.  targeting
B.  branding
C.  positioning. Positioning is the act of designing a companyâs offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the minds of the target market.
D.  segmentation
E.  differentiation

The value creation and delivery sequence consists of three phases. In the first phase, choosing the value, marketers segment the market, select the appropriate target, and develop the offeringâs value positioning.

Perceptual maps are visual representations of consumer perceptions and preferences. By overlaying consumer preferences with brandâ perceptions, marketers can revealâ "holes" orâ "openings" that suggest unmet consumer needs and marketing opportunities.


### Segmentation (Slaying the Mythical Beast)

Employing a process of dividing a heterogeneous market into homogeneous subsets of customers -- or segments.

Demographics: We are not alike!

Campbell Soup & Curtis Publishing Co.
Charles curtis parlor (parlen prize, given by the ... , equivalent of the nobel prize)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Publishing_Company
http://trashtidbits.blogspot.com/2008/03/campbell-soup-garbage.html

"More than 125 years have passed since advertising pioneer N.W. Ayer conducted the first organized marketing research project in 1879. A second important milestone is the development of marketing research occurred 32 years later, when Charles C. Parlin organized the nation's first commercial research department at Curtis Publishing Co., publisher of The Saturday Evening Post.

Parlin got his start as a marketing researcher by counting soup cans in Philadelphia's garbage. Here is what happened. Parlin, an ad salesman, was trying to convince the Campbell Soup Co. to advertise in The Saturday Evening Post. Campbell Soup resisted, believing that the Post reached primarily working-class readers, who preferred to make their own soup. Campbell Soup marketers were targeting higher income people who could afford to pay for the convenience of soup in a can. To prove Campbell wrong, Parlin began counting soup cans in the garbage collected from different neighborhoods. His research revealed that working-class families bought more canned soup than wealthy households, who had servants to cook for them. Campbell Soup soon became a regular Saturday Evening Post client. It is interesting to note that garbage remains a good source of information for marketing researchers even today. Prior to recent cutbacks in food service, some airlines studied the leftovers from on board meals to determine what to serve passengers."

#### Pricing strategies
A.  Discount pricing
B.  Perceived-value pricing
C.  Markup pricing
D.  Auction-type pricing
E.  Variable pricing

Tactic:
?   Lack-of-demand pricing
B.  Anticipatory pricing
C.  ?Over-demand pricing
D.  Hedge pricing
E.  Reduction of discounts


CMO:
Your tasks include: estimating demand, choosing between cost-based and value-based pricing, selecting an initial price for the product based on available cost data, and adjusting the price based on changes in the market
The first factor to consider in pricing is who your demographic is
You next move on to estimating demand
Now you examine the costs
Market Penetration Pricing: Charge a lower price in order to gain market share
Market Skimming Pricing: Charge a higher price in order to make more profit quickly.

## Key learnings
Core product needs to be appealing to targeted customer segment. Monopoly is easy: false loyals.

In competitive environment products cannot be customized to all customer segments
- Easy to get greedy and target too many segments with one product
- word of mouth is missing. product lacks the "oomph"

* Need strategies to grow the market
- pioneering
- Growing the pie: whose job?

Who is responsible for growing the market?

## What CMOs claim marketing does

It;s not an expense but an investment. What is the dialog you need to have?

Boards have neglected marketing
* Discussions about cusomters are purely anecdotal
* Need to get in the coversation

Boards spend less thatn 10% of ther time on marketing.

CEO's and Board's attention is dominated by Finance.

### A breave new world

* New reality:
Global standards; non-level playing fields; intense rivalry; winners and losers.

* Constant improvement to stay on top.
- Those who don't serve (customers) well end up losing
- Not just distance but the direction

* Intelligence:
- Learning from our defeats is obvious.
* enjoy your victories, but learn from -- victories and defeats.!!

* Lucky: need to be marginally "smarter" than the competition

What is co-branding? Marketers often combine their products with products from other companies in various ways. In co-brandingâalso called dual branding or brand bundlingâtwo or more well-known brands are combined into a joint product or marketed together in some fashion.

Forâ co-branding toâ succeed, the two brands separately must have brand equityâ (adequate brand awareness and a sufficiently positive brandâ image).
