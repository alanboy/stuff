The following paragraphs are excerpts from [Geoffrey A. Moore's "Crossing the Chasm, 3rd Edition: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers (Collins Business Essentials)"](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=asc_df_0062292986/?).

# High-Tech Marketing Illusion
## The innovations
Crossing the chasm introduces two kinds of change: 
* **disruptive**, (or discontinuous), innovation gets us to change our behavior or the products we use 
* **sustaining**, (or continuous), innovation entails steady improvements and upgrades to products that don’t make us change
our behavior.

Any time we are introduced to products that require us to change our current mode of behavior or to modify other products and services we rely on. In academic terms, such change-sensitive products are called discontinuous or disruptive innovations. The contrasting term, continuous or sustaining innovations, refers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require us to change behavior. As a consumer, you don’t have to change your ways in order to take advantage of these improvements.

Between continuous and discontinuous lies a spectrum of demands for behavioral change.

## The high tech markets and the Technology Adoption Life Cycle

The book defines a market as a set of actual or potential customers for a given set of products or services who have a common set of needs or wants, and who reference each other when making a buying decision. If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market. This is extremely useful and it really helps in forming a clear division on our marketing segmentations.  The book goes into huge detail about the characteristics of each market, and some of the most memorable learnings for me were:

* **Innovators/Technology enthusiasts** seek out novel technology; it’s like a hobby for them. There aren’t many Innovators, and because they’ll try new things, they are important. Other people see them use new things and feel braver themselves about trying them. Innovators pursue new technology products aggressively. Innovators pursue new technology products aggressively. They sometimes seek them out even before a formal marketing program has been launched. This is because technology is a central interest in their life, regardless of what function it is performing.
* **Early Adopters/Visionaries** are quick to understand the benefits of new technology. Unlike the Innovators, they don’t love technology for its own sake. This group relies on its own intuition and vision to make buying decisions. They are people who find it easy to
imagine, understand, and appreciate the benefits of new technology. organization to buy into that project.  Visionaries are not looking for improvement; they are looking for a fundamental breakthrough. Technology is important only insomuch as it promises to deliver on this dream.
  * **Early adopters**, like innovators, buy into new product concepts very early in their life cycle, but unlike innovators, they are not technologists. Rather they are people who find it easy to imagine, understand, and appreciate the benefits of a new technology, and to relate these potential benefits to their other concerns. Whenever they find a strong match, early adopters are willing to base their buying decisions upon it. Because early adopters do not rely on well-established references in making these buying decisions, preferring instead to rely on their own intuition and vision, they are core to opening up any high-tech market segment.
  * **Visionaries** represent an opportunity early in a product’s life cycle to generate a burst of revenue and gain exceptional visibility. The opportunity comes with a price tag—a highly demanding customer who will seek to influence your company’s priorities directly and a high-risk project that could end in disappointment for all.

* **Early Majority/Pragmatists** are practical-minded consumers. If a product seems useful, this group will try it. The Early Majority are cautious of fads. **They want to see well-established references before investing substantially**. As individuals, pragmatists held back from using software-as-a-service applications until salesforce.com made it safe to enter the water. Pragmatists want to buy from proven market leaders because they know that third parties will design supporting products around a market-leading product. That is, market-leading products create an aftermarket that other vendors service. 
* **Late Majority/Conservative** consumers wait for something to become well established. They don’t feel confident in their ability to deal with technology and often buy from big companies. Members of the late majority are not comfortable with their ability to handle a technology product. Conservatives like to buy preassembled packages, with everything bundled, at a heavily discounted price. The last thing they want to hear is that the software they just bought doesn’t support the home network they have installed. They want high-tech products to be like refrigerators—you open the door, the light comes on automatically, your food stays cold, and you don’t have to think about it. The products they understand best are those dedicated to a single function—music, video, email, games. The late majority shares all the concerns of the early majority, plus one major additional one: Whereas people in the early majority are comfortable with their ability to handle a technology product, should they finally decide to purchase it, members of the late majority are not. As a result, they wait until something has become an established standard, and even then they want to see lots of support and tend to buy, therefore, from large, well-established companies. 
* **Laggards/Skeptics** are those consumers who, for personal and/or economic reasons, are not looking to buy new technology. These people simply don’t want anything to do with new technology, for any of a variety of reasons. The primary function of high-tech marketing in relation to skeptics is to neutralize their influence. One of the favorite arguments of skeptics is that disruptive innovation of any kind rarely fulfill their promises and almost always come with unintended consequences. These people simply don’t want anything to do with new technology, for any of a variety of reasons, some personal and some economic. The only time they ever buy a technological product is when it is buried deep inside another product—the way, say, that a microprocessor is designed into the braking system of a new car—such that they don’t even know it is there. 

Moving from one market to the other is filled with dilemmas from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions. To illustrate, because of incompatibilities, early adopters do not make good references for the early majority. And because of the early majority’s concern not to disrupt their organizations, good references are critical to their buying decisions. The only suitable reference for an early majority customer, it turns out, is another member of the early majority, but no upstanding member of the early majority will buy without first having consulted with several suitable references.  But the point of greatest danger in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary customers to a mainstream market dominated by a large block of customers. It is all the more dangerous because it typically goes unrecognized.

## High-Tech Marketing Enlightenment

**The gap between these two markets is in fact so significant as to warrant being called a chasm, and crossing this chasm must be the primary focus of any long-term high-tech marketing plan.** One of the most important lessons about crossing the chasm is that the task ultimately requires achieving an unusual degree of company unity during the crossing period.

Defining marketing is not particularly difficult: It simply means taking actions to create, grow, maintain, or defend markets.

Market, which we will define, for the purposes of high tech, as: 
* a set of actual or potential customers 
* for a given set of products or services 
* who have a common set of needs or wants, and 
* who reference each other when making a buying decision.

If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market.

That is, if I sell an oscilloscope for monitoring heartbeats to a doctor in Boston and the identical product for the same purpose to a doctor in Zaire, and these two doctors have no reasonable basis for communicating with each other, then I am dealing in two different markets.

Marketing professionals insist on market segmentation because they know that no meaningful marketing program can be implemented across a set of customers who do not reference each other. The

# Early Markets

To get an early market started requires an entrepreneurial company with a breakthrough technology product that enables a new and compelling application,
a technology enthusiast who can evaluate and appreciate the superiority of the product over current alternatives,

and a well-heeled visionary who can foresee an order-of-magnitude improvement from implementing the new application.

Dan Warmenhoven at NetApp, Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn, John Chen at Sybase, John Donahoe at eBay, even such visible leaders as Meg Whitman at HP and Michael Dell at Dell—low on drama, high on integrity and commitment.


They tend to be best known by their closest colleagues, from whom they typically have earned the highest respect, and by their peers within their industry, where they show up near the top of the leaderboard year after year.

As individuals, pragmatists held back from using software-as-a-service applications until Salesforce.com made it safe to enter the water,

held back from supporting bring-your-own-device policies until companies like MobileIron and Airwatch offered mobile device management solutions, and held back from investing in video until Cisco made telepresence a household word.

If pragmatists are hard to win over, they are loyal once won,

When pragmatists buy, they care about the company they are buying from, the quality of the product they are buying, the infrastructure of supporting products and system interfaces, and the reliability of the service they are going to get. In other words, they are planning on living with this decision personally for a long time to come.


there is a kind of catch-22 operating: Pragmatists won’t buy from you until you are established, yet you can’t get established until they buy from you.

One final characteristic of pragmatist buyers is that they like to see competition—in part to get costs down, in part to have the security of more than one alternative to fall back on should anything go wrong, and in part to assure themselves they are buying from a proven market leader.

This last point is crucial: Pragmatists want to buy from proven market leaders because they know that third parties will design supporting products around a market-leading product.

That is, market-leading products create an aftermarket that other vendors service.

Market leadership is crucial, therefore, to winning pragmatist customers.

to market to pragmatists, you must be patient. You need to be conversant with the issues that dominate their particular business. You need to show up at the industry-specific conferences and trade shows they attend. You need to be mentioned in articles that run in the newsletters and blogs they read. You need to be installed in other companies in their industry. You need to have developed applications for your product that are specific to their industry. You need to have partnerships and alliances with the other vendors who serve their industry. You need to have earned a reputation for quality and service. In short, you need to make yourself over into the obvious supplier of choice.

Conservatives, in essence, are against discontinuous innovations. They believe far more in tradition than in progress.

Conservatives like to buy preassembled packages, with everything bundled, at a heavily discounted price. The last thing they want to hear is that the software they just bought doesn’t support the home network they have installed. They want high-tech products to be like refrigerators—you open the door, the light comes on automatically, your food stays cold, and you don’t have to think about it. The products they understand best are those dedicated to a single function—music, video, email, games. The notion that a single device could do all four of these functions does not excite them—instead, it is something they find vaguely nauseating.

Conservatives are indeed price sensitive, but that is largely because they cannot get full value from their user experience.

Overall, one has the feeling that the conservative market is still perceived more as a burden than an opportunity.

This is still extraordinarily high for enterprise IT software, and while it has created a lot of income for systems integrators, it has left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth, so the less of it, the better.

The Apple iPad is a wonderful example here, for it appeals not only to technology enthusiasts and visionaries (“It is just so cool!”), but equally so to pragmatists (“No training costs!”) and to conservatives (“No training, period!”). When you watch a toddler playing with one, you realize just how far we have come from control-alt-delete.

One of the favorite arguments of skeptics is that disruptive innovations of any kind rarely fulfill their promises and almost always come with unintended consequences. This combination of elusive reward with omnipresent risk just looks to them like a bad bet.


Indeed, making the marketing and communications transition between any two adoption segments is normally excruciatingly awkward because you must adopt new strategies just at the time you have become most comfortable with the old ones.

## Innovators: The Technology Enthusiasts. 
Classically, the first people to adopt any new technology are those who appreciate the technology for its own sake.
They are the ones who first appreciate the architecture of your product and why it therefore has a competitive advantage over the current crop of products established in the marketplace.
They are the ones who will spend hours trying to get products to work that, in all conscience, never should have been shipped in the first place.
As a buying population, or as key influencers in corporate buying decisions, technology enthusiasts pose fewer requirements than any other group in the adoption profile

* First, and most crucially, they want the truth, and without any tricks.
* Second, wherever possible, whenever they have a technical problem, they want access to the most technically knowledgeable person to answer it.
* Third, they want to be first to get the new stuff.
* Finally, they want everything cheap.

To reach technology enthusiasts, you need to place your message in one of their various haunts—on the Web, of course.

Just don’t waste your money on a lot of fancy image advertising—they read all that as marketing hype.

That said, for the most part, these people are not powerful enough to dictate the buying decisions of others, nor do they represent a significant market in themselves
What they represent instead is a sounding board for initial product or service features and a test bed for introducing modifications to the product or service until it is thoroughly “debugged.”

The way to cherish them is to let them in on the secret, to let them play with the product and give you their feedback, and wherever appropriate, to implement the improvements they suggest and to let them know that you implemented them.

## Early Adopters: The Visionaries

Visionaries are that rare breed of people who have the insight to match up an emerging technology to a strategic opportunity, the temperament to translate that insight into a high-visibility, high-risk project, and the charisma to get the rest of their organization to buy into that project.

As a class, visionaries tend to be recent entrants to the executive ranks, highly motivated, and driven by a “dream.”

The core of the dream is a business goal, not a technology goal, and it involves taking a quantum leap forward in how business is conducted in their industry or by their customers.

Visionaries are not looking for an improvement; they are looking for a fundamental breakthrough. Technology is important only insomuch as it promises to deliver on this dream.

The key point is that, in contrast with the technology enthusiast, a visionary focuses on value not from a system’s technology per se but rather from the strategic leap forward such technology can enable.

First, visionaries like a project orientation.

The other key quality of visionaries is that they are in a hurry. They see the future in terms of windows of opportunity, and they see those windows closing. As a result, they tend to exert deadline pressures—the carrot of a big payment or the stick of a penalty clause—to drive the project faster.

This plays into the classic weaknesses of entrepreneurs—lust after the big score and overconfidence in their ability to execute within any given time frame.

Here again, account management and executive restraint are crucial. The goal should be to package each of the phases such that each phase:

* is accomplishable by mere mortals working in earth time
* provides the vendor with a marketable product
* provides the customer with a concrete return on investment that can be celebrated as a major step forward.

In terms of prospecting for visionaries, they are not likely to have a particular job title, except that, to be truly useful, they must have achieved at least a senior vice presidential level in order to have the clout to fund their visions. In fact, in terms of communications, typically you don’t find them, they find you.

In sum, visionaries represent an opportunity early in a product’s life cycle to generate a burst of revenue and gain exceptional visibility.

The opportunity comes with a price tag—a highly demanding customer who will seek to influence your company’s priorities directly and a high-risk project that could end in disappointment for all.

Visionaries are the ones who give high-tech companies their first big break. It is hard to plan for them in marketing programs, but it is even harder to plan without them.

# Mainstream Market

Just as the visionaries drive the development of the early market, so do the pragmatists drive the development of the mainstream market.

In the last decade, high tech has truly come to grips with this phenomenon by actively reconfiguring its product offers as services.
                
Software as a service (SaaS), data center infrastructure as a service (IaaS), development and deployment platform software as a service (PaaS)—all are creating a new stack in the cloud, that virtualized space to which more and more computing is migrating.
                
This is service-as-a-tax, adding no value, being simply the price you have to pay to get the stuff to work.
                
This is still extraordinarily high for enterprise IT software, and while it has created a lot of income for systems integrators, it has left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth, so the less of it, the better.
                
The Apple iPad is a wonderful example here, for it appeals not only to technology enthusiasts and visionaries (“It is just so cool!”), but equally so to pragmatists (“No training costs!”) and to conservatives (“No training, period!”). When you watch a toddler playing with one, you realize just how far we have come from control-alt-delete.
                

## Laggards: The Skeptics
                
Skeptics—the group that makes up the last one-sixth of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle—do not participate in the high-tech marketplace, except to block purchases. Thus,
                
the primary function of high-tech marketing in relation to skeptics is to neutralize their influence.
                
One of the favorite arguments of skeptics is that disruptive innovations of any kind rarely fulfill their promises and almost always come with unintended consequences.
                
This combination of elusive reward with omnipresent risk just looks to them like a bad bet.
                
What skeptics are struggling to point out is that new systems, for the most part, don’t deliver on the promises that were made at the time of their purchase.
                
This is not to say they do not end up delivering value, but rather that the value they actually deliver is not often anticipated at the time of purchase.
                
## Back to the Chasm

Indeed, making the marketing and communications transition between any two adoption segments is normally excruciatingly awkward because you must adopt new strategies just at the time you have become most comfortable with the old ones.
                
The biggest problem during this transition period is the lack of a customer base that can be referenced at the time of making the transition into a new segment.
                
Visionaries take a greater interest in technology than in their industry.
                
You meet them at technology conferences and other futurist forums where people gather to forecast trends and seek out new market opportunities.
                
They are bored with the mundane details of their own industries. They like to talk and think high tech.
                
Pragmatists, on the other hand, don’t put a lot of stake in futuristic things. They see themselves more in present-day terms, as the people devoted to making the wheels of their industry turn.

Visionaries fail to acknowledge the importance of existing product infrastructure. Visionaries are building systems from the ground up. They are incarnating their vision. They do not expect to find components for these systems lying around.
                
Pragmatists expect all these things. When they see visionaries forging their own paths with little or no thought of connecting with the mainstream practices in their industry, they shudder.
                
“industry standard.” The problem goes beyond pitches and positioning, though. It is fundamentally a problem of time. The high-tech vendor wants—indeed, needs—the pragmatist to buy now, and the pragmatist needs—or at least wants—to wait.



# D-Day Analogy

Nor can managers find safety through continuing to service just the early market. To be sure, there are still sales opportunities here—other visionaries who can be sold to.

But each one is going to have a unique dream, leading to unique demands for customization, which in turn will overtax an already burdened product development group.

Moreover, sooner or later in this early market, yet another entrepreneur with a yet more innovative technology, and with a yet better story to tell, will come along. By then you have to be across the chasm and established in the mainstream, or you are out of luck.

You must get into a mainstream market segment soon, establishing long-term relationships with pragmatist buyers, for only through these can you control your own destiny.

## Fighting Your Way into the Mainstream

To enter the mainstream market is an act of aggression. The companies who have already established relationships with your target customer will resent your intrusion and do everything they can to shut you out.

The customers themselves will be suspicious of you as a new and untried player in their marketplace. No one wants your presence. You are an invader.
                

This is not a time to focus on being nice. As we have already said, the perils of the chasm make this a life-or-death situation for you.
                

The comparison is straightforward enough. Our long-term goal is to enter and take control of a mainstream market (Western Europe) that is currently dominated by an entrenched competitor (the Axis).
                

For our product to wrest the mainstream market from this competitor, we must assemble an invasion force comprising other products and companies (the Allies).
                

By way of entry into this market, our immediate goal is to transition from an early market base (England) to a strategic target market segment in the mainstream (the beaches at Normandy).
                

Separating us from our goal is the chasm (the English Channel). We are going to cross that chasm as fast as we can with an invasion force focused directly and exclusively on the point of attack (D-Day).
                

Once we force the competitor out of our targeted niche markets (secure the beachhead), then we will move out to take over adjacent market segments (districts of France) on the way toward overall market domination (the liberation of Western Europe).
                

That’s it. That’s the strategy. Replicate D-Day, and win entry to the mainstream. Cross the chasm by targeting a very specific niche market where you can dominate from the outset, drive your competitors out of that market niche, and then use it as a base for broader operations.

Concentrate an overwhelmingly superior force on a highly focused target.
                
The D-Day strategy prevents this mistake. It has the ability to galvanize an entire enterprise by focusing it on a highly specific goal that is 1) readily achievable and 2) capable of being directly leveraged into long-term success.
                
Most companies fail to cross the chasm because, confronted with the immensity of opportunity represented by a mainstream market, they lose their focus, chasing every opportunity that presents itself, but finding themselves unable to deliver a salable proposition to any true pragmatist buyer.





## Assemble the Invasion Force

In fact, marketing’s most powerful contribution happens right in between. It is called whole product marketing, a term introduced earlier, and it is the fundamental basis for assembling the invasion force.
                
We might call it wiring the marketplace. Again, the concept is simple. For a given target customer and a given application, create a marketplace in which your product is the only reasonable buying proposition.
                
To secure that monopoly, you need to understand 1) what a whole product consists of and 2) how to organize a marketplace to provide a whole product incorporating your company’s offering.
                
## The Whole Product Concept
                
The concept is very straightforward: There is a gap between the marketing promise made to the customer—the compelling value proposition—and the ability of the shipped product to fulfill that promise.
                
## THE WHOLE PRODUCT MODEL
                
* Generic product: This is what is shipped in the box and what is covered by the purchasing contract.
* Expected product: This is the product that the consumer thought she was buying when she bought the generic product. It is the minimum configuration of products and services necessary to have any chance of achieving the buying objective.
* Augmented product: This is the product fleshed out to provide the maximum chance of achieving the buying objective.
* Potential product: This represents the product’s room for growth as more and more ancillary products come on the market and as customer-specific enhancements to the system are made.
                
The Whole Product and the Technology Adoption Life Cycle
                
For now, our focus should be on the minimum commitment to whole product needed to cross the chasm.

That is defined by the whole product that assures that the target customers can fulfill their compelling reason to buy.

Failure to meet this promise in a business-to-business market has extremely serious consequences.

In short, if you wanted to trace disillusionment with high tech’s inability to deliver on its promise to its investors and its customers, lack of attention to whole product marketing is the closest thing to a wellspring.


## Conclusion
Even though many readers think the concepts are not new and that the book rather captured
what had been for them scattered intuitions and rueful learnings and put them into a coherent
set of frameworks that could be used for future decision making, I see the framework as a
discontinuous innovation since it changes the way you interact with hight tech markets.
The classic weaknesses of entrepreneurs—lust after the big score and overconfidence in their
ability to execute within any given time frame is softened by using a prescribed framework like
the technology adoption lifecycle.
