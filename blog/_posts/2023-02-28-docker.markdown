description: Some stuff I find useful when working with Docker containers

Docker is a platform that lets you package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that can run consistently across different environments. Here are some of the commands that I routinely use.

Starting a shell inside the container:

    docker exec -it b403b7b43afe /bin/bash

List all containers.

    docker ps
