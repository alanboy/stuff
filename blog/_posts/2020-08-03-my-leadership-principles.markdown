## Kindness
Everything you do, do it with kindness. If you say yes, do it with kindness, when you say no, do it with kindness.

I can be very pushy and demanding. Especially with my own managers.

Embrace discomfort.

## Managing up
Always considering what my manager cares for. Do I work for a bigger cause, or do I work for him/her?


## Considerations
It's been difficult for me to stop considering alternatives and something definitive
It's been difficult for me to take it easy and be more flexible

My habit of being "Stand-offish" has annoyed people
I have tended to be moody and self-absorbed
I have been too uncompromising and demanding with others.
I've created problems with others by being bossy and controlling
When I've debated with friends, I've tended to press my arguments forcefully.
I have gotten into trouble with people by being too intrusive and interfering.

## Clarity and shared understanding
* Navigating ambiguity.
* Times of distress. When people want to help but its hard because there it hard to get organized. Exacerbated by the stress.

## Teaching

## Luck

Luck is opporunity meating preparation.

## Personality and Identity

## Privilege

Understand my privilege. See how i feel about various social identity dimensions.

I don't know what it's like to be you and you don't know what it's like to be me.

    "There is not a day that goes by where I am not reminded that I am Black"

We cannot choose to have a privilege, we can choose to share it. 

## Other

- Be someone that is prepared.
