## Managing up
Always considering what my manager cares for.
Do I work for a bigger cause, or do I work for him/her?

## Kindness
Everything you do, do it with kindness. If you say yes, do it with kindness, when you say no, do it with kindness.

I can be very pushy and demanding. Especially with my managers.

I have received feedback that i talk to people as if they were dumb.

## Considerations
It's been difficult for me to stop considerint alternatives and something definitive
It's been difficult for me to take it easy and be more flexible

My habit of being "Stand-offish" has annoyed people
I have tended to be moddy and self-absorbed
I have been too uncompromising and demanding with others.
I've created problems with others by being bossy and controlling
When I've debated with friends, I've tended to press my arguments forcefully.
I have gotten into trouble with people by being too intrusive and interfering.
