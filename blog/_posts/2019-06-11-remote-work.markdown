Joel used a motor analogy to describe two types of works. Some people have a self-winding internal motor??
if you leave them alone for two weeks even with no instruction, they will do two weeks worth of work. 

Other people have motors that need to be wound every day??they really benefit from having a daily touchpoint.
Both types of workers can be effective, as long as you know what type you are dealing with and work with them appropriately.
