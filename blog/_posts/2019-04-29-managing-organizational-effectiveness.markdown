## Extrinsic and intrinsic foundations of motivation
### What is motivation?
The process of arousing and sustaining goal-directed behavior. Motivation is an internal mental state that energizes human behavior in an intended direction. [Definition Ref](http://www.aui.ma/personal/~A.Cads/1201/Mod2/M2-links/L1-%20Educational%20Psychology%20Interactive%20Motivation.htm)

    Individual Performance = f(Motivation X Ability)

* **Extrinsic motivation** – desire to perform a behavior in order to acquire material or social rewards or to avoid punishment (pay, praise, and status).
* **Intrinsic motivation** – desire to perform a behavior for its own sake; workers believe that the work gives them a sense of accomplishment and achievement or that they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.

| Extrinsic Rewards: Economic | Extrinsic Rewards: Noneconomic | Intrinsic Rewards |

| Nonrecurring financial rewards | Recognition | Personal Growth |
| Fringe benefits | Time off | Achievement |

Case 
* Money (and other extrinsic rewards) motivates, but it is ineffective in promoting creativityand knowledge-intensive performance
* Unless you make non-economic non-extrinsic incentives matter in your organization, outstanding achievements, particularly creativity and innovation, will be unlikely in it 
* Be aware of the effort effect and its implications for hiring and task assignment [The effort effect.](https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-effort-effect)

# Effectiveness from Diversity

Better understand the opportunities and pitfalls of diversity in organizations to, improve organizational effectiveness and avoid legal problems.

## Three Paradigms of Diversity
1. Assimilation
2. Differentiation
3. Integration 

## Discrimination

Discrimination is disadvantaging people because they belong to protected classes (groups): Sex, Sexual orientation, Race, Color, Creed, Age ... (and more).

* Case: Joseph and the Company Party
* Case: The Part-time Partner

## Types of Discrimination in Organizations

* Taste discrimination – disadvantaging people because of disliking the group they belong to
* Statistical discrimination – disadvantaging individuals because of low average performance in groups they belong to
* Error discrimination – same as statistical discrimination, except that the belief about the average group performance is wrong
* Disparate impact –using a trait correlated with group membership to discriminate (e.g. Latinos get disadvantaged if height is used as a criterion in hiring to police)
* Internalized prejudice, or self-discrimination – belief that certain positions are not appropriate for members of your own group

## Cases
* Case: Thomas, D. & Ely, R.  “Making Differences Matter: A New Paradigm for Managing Diversity.”  Harvard Business Review, September/October, 1996, pp. 79-90.
* Case  :  Loveman, Gary. “The case of the part-time partner.”   Harvard Business Review, September/October 1990.
* Mini-Case  :  Okhuysen, Gerardo. 2013. Joseph and the Company Party.

# Effectiveness from Culture

Culture is shared understanding of what actions and symbols mean.

Types of Culture Most Consequential for Business

1. Organizational Reese (1996), Elon Musk
1. Regional Saxenian (1996)
1. National

        "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.” -Ken Olsen, CEO of DEC, 1977

Management of culture helps organizations be effective by aligning the culture with its goals. Organizations that ignore the management of culture miss out on a major way of improving effectiveness. Locating the company or team in the appropriate culture is one way of aligning its culture with goals

Wikipedia article on DEC (skim): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation 3. Reese, Jennifer. 1996. Inside the Coffee Cult. Fortune. 4. Musk, Elon. “Acronyms Seriously Suck.”

# Effectiveness from Networks
Social networks are patterns of relations (among people or groups or organizations)

* Bill Gates -> Mary Gates -> John Opel.
* Cosimo de Medici (1389-1464)
* Paul Revere

After a basic level of competence, it's about your network. The structure of the network is of higher value. 

## Basic Network Concepts
* Tie
 * Directed – may be asymmetric
 * Not directed – always symmetric
* Node – network member (e.g. person or firm)
* Indegree - # of ties received
* Outdegree - # of ties sent
* Isolate – node with no ties
* Centrality

## Bridges and Brokers
Using Brokers

## An Effective Individual Network
1. A mix of weak and strong ties
1. Rich in brokerage opportunities
1. A combination of professional and social relations (e.g. trust)
1. Built with brokers’ introductions 
1. Built in joint activities

## Other networks
* Erdös Numbers
* Kevin Bacon Numbers

# Origings and Rewards of Creativity
* Creativity is generation of **new** and **valuable** ideas
* Innovation is successful implementation of such ideas

## Origins of Innovation
1. **Technical**: Innovation happens due to technical ideas
2. **Personality**: Innovation happens due to personal traits of individuals, particularly organizational leaders
3. **Organizational**: Innovation happens because of how formal and informal organizations are designed and managed

Innovation happens in networks, requires constant interpersonal communication.

1. Intrinsic rewards
1. Networks
1. Incremental improvement
1. Organizational welfare

* Briding capital. Sparse egocentric network. You connect disconnected poeple. Facilitates creativity.
* Bonding capital. Dense egocentric networks. Your every contact is connected to almost every other contact. Facilitates innovation.

Creativity is risky, most creative projects fail.
