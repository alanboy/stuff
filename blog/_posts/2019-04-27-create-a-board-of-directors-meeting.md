# Preparing for a board of directors meeting

### Preparation

* By-laws
  * Row call by the secretary: Do we have quorum?
  * How are we going to come to an agreement?
  * Roles: president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer
* Agenda
  * Notes from previous meeting.
  * Seating chart
* Content

### Meeting

### Presentation vs Discussion
Prepare a board meeting that is not a presentation. Have the presenter send the document to the participants in advance.
