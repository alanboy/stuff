# Introduction

2 types of entrepreneurship

IDE. Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship
SME. Small 

# Business plan

```
Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.
```

Does a startup actually need a business plan?

Academic exercise? vs actually get things going.

Money tends to flow to where opportunity is.

* Create value
* Figure out way to capture the value.


10-20-30 rule.

10 slides, 20 minutes, 30pt font.

# Public speaking

## How to start
* Joke? Not recommended.
* Empowerment Promise.

Happiness = Reality / Expectations

# Marketing

```
People are predictably irrational.
```


# Sales

If you are speaking, you are selling. 

Good salespeople solve customers' problems.

The right mindset.

Solution vs a Product.

Genuine desire to help people.

Pushy over-agressive... sales is a noble profession. 

* Rejection
* Failure
* Quota

The number one job of a sales professional is to: solve a customers problem.

Standard Sales Training
* Ask leading questions
* Present your solutions

All this before you win the trust.


Three S's for a salespersons mindset when selling to the customer:
* Adopt a servant's mindset
* Share your experience.
* Solve their problem.

Mindset self-evaluation:
* Do you care about other people's problems?
* Do you share great ideas and experiences (like movie or restaurant)?
* Do you instinctively offer solutions to help others?


The mind of the buyer:

Think about the position of the buyer, by positioning yourelf when you are the one in the buyers seat. People buy from people they trust, they trust people they like, and thye like people they connect with. 

Don't launch too early into the "pitch" presentation; you by-pass the customers trust process, it send the brain into a mode of skepticism and judgement. 

* Safety
* Connection
* Trust
* Understanding
* Opportunity
* Credibility

The customer in in resist or run mode from the get-go. There is so much selling and marketing out there, that users are in a resist mode. Defense mechanisms are high.

* Can you create trust by connecting trough mutual beliefs?
* Can you reinforce trust through understanding and empathy?
* Can you clearly show them a path forward to their success?
* Can you demonstrate your ability to solve problems?

#### Shotgun approach
Advertising a general sales message in hopes that a customer will take note and purchase your product.

Who is the ideal customer.
* Value your product or service
* Help you make a profit
* Refer you to other potential customer


* Ready: Do you they have a problem? Do they know they have a problem?
* Willing: Are they currently searching?
* Able: Do they have the budget? Authority?

How do we find this ideal customer. Start by creating **personas** or profiles.

Understand your customers issues. Research your customers issues! Unover issues when you are talking to the customer. Don't think you know the customers problems. Understand the customers problems trough their lens, not yours.

The four I's
* Uncover the Issue
* Identify the impact. Quantify the problem.
* Determine invasiveness.
* Break down the iceberg

Buying motivators:
* Price
* Value (benefit vs price)
* Quality
* Self-preservation. Highly emotional. 
* Social pressure

### The barriers to change

`Awareness + Motivation + Ability = Change`

* Does your customer have the awareness that they need to change?
* How motivated are they to make changes?
* How easily can they implement changes?

Barriers to accepting change:
* Anxiety
* Isolation
* Feeling of potential loss
* Feeling overwhelmed
* Reverting back to old ways.

Why
How

**Psychology vs Biology**

* Startup cost
* Fixed cost
* Variable cost

## Funding
