* **Net Profit** Gross Profit minus sales, administrative and general expenses (SG&A)

## The disclosure process

SEC regulation FD, for "fair disclosure" requires that companies ..

Good news = earnings per share.

Prior years, same quarter

Financial analysts, market research, specialized in industries, the provide analysts forecasts.

Market expectation in media usually means the mean (analyst consensus) /median of all available forecasts.

Many companies report their own forecasts. The company has more information. Management forecasts means that the companies voluntarily (voluntary disclosure).

Some papers report that outsider analysts are better at forecasting than management forecasts.

Gross profit for Costco is around 10%.

It is intentional that Costco to have low gross profit.

Current ratio = current assets/current liability.

current means that 1 year of business cycle.

The value of a company is coming from operations (finance activities does not add value to the company). Companies cannot add value from financial activities, just from operating activities.

## How stock price is determined
Value of a co or stock price is decided by discounted sum all future expected dividends.

Operating cash flow.

    100 dollars in the bank at interest rate r.
    100 x (1.1) = 110
    100 x (1.1)^2 = 121

Because many companies don't do dividends, many professors with `(bSE + NI - div = eSE)`.

## Accounting valuation model

Real stock price is computed based on the number of transactions.

Financial assets cannot generate money above interest rate.

## Ratios
ROE => Financial leverage

## The DuPont Model

    ROE = Net Profit Margin * Total asset turnover * Financial leverage

## Financial statement
### Preparing financial statement

```
                         2018
    |-------------------------------------------|
 12/31                                        12/31
  2017                                         2018
   B/S                                         eB/S
```

Many transactions happened in 2018. We want to summarize all those and prepare ending balance sheet

We can write that in the income statement.

Depreciation expense ( debit expense ^ , **accumulated depreciation** is a contra-asset).

With the closing process we get **retained earnings** and that we can put in the balance sheet.

## Accounting for Net Sales Revenue

Economic resources that require sacrifice of ...  benefit.

### Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition => when we can report in the income statement.
Reporting revenues in the income statement.

We can do that Realized (cash is collected) or realizable AND earned (product delivered)

Account receivable. Is an asset, right to collect cash in the future.

The benefit of selling something on account is increasing revenue.

When companies accept credit cards, they cannot collect 100% (uncollectable receivables, called credit losses) if they become uncollectable as bad debt expense.

### Expense recognition principle / matching principle

Under current GAAP. Based on recognition principle, report on the same period on when the revenue is recorded.

Revenues generated by this expense.

Match expense with revenue. US GAP requires certain method to report expenses in this way. Allowance method.

    1. AR 1000 (company sold something on account)
       REV 1000


AR = 1,000 (some of these will not be collectable, the ammount of uncollectable ammount will be x)
Lets say 5% of this AR will not be collectable.

The 5% goes to another account called allowance. This is when we recognize bad debt expense.

(Based on estimation)

    2. Bad debt expense 50    Allowance 50

- Expense = small thing / windshield / starbucks cup of coffee
- Capitalize = turbo charger / milk

Once it actually happened:

    3. Allowance 50    AR 50

## Matching principle ##

The revenue and the expense must be reported in the same period.

    2018   1. AR 1000       Rev       1000
       2. Bad debt 50   Allowance 50

    2019   3. Allowance 50  AR        50

Let's say the company that was bankrupt we realize we can now collect.

    4. AR 30  Allowance 30
       Cash 30   AR 30

# Inventory

- Merchandisers: WalMart, Costco = Purchase finished goods from suppliers. Ready for re-sale.
  - Finished goods inventory

- Manufacturers: Boeing, Toyota
 - Raw materials inventory
 - Work in process inveontory
 - Finished goods inventory

Inventory costs includes the costs to bring an article to usable or salable condition and location.

Actual flow.
Cost flow. (Assumed flow, based on assumptions)

## Inventory costing methods ###

- Specific identification (diamonds)
- First-in, first-out
- Last-in, first-out
- Average cost

Merrimack Tractors and Mowers
Cost flows might not be the same as actual flow.
Assumptions of inventory can be LIFO, FIFO, average.


    Beginning balance + Purchases - CGS = Ending balance

For Merrimack case 8. We need to change the beginning balance assumption from LIFO to FIFO.

LIFO reserve, companies need to report the LIFO reserve.

    Beginning balance in LIFO = 13.5M
    Beginning balance in FIFO = 13.5M + 5.5M = 19M


- Inflation: Prices go up. You want to buy right away because prices will go up.
- Deflation: Prices go down. If you expect prices to go down then people will NOT buy because they will always wait (to get a cheaper price).
