## Searching
Delete all lines **containing** "matchingstring":

    :%g/matchingstring/d

Delete all lines **NOT** containing "matchingstring":

    :%g!/matchingstring/d

or

    :v/matchingstring/d

Search by hex code:

    \%x1b

## Spelling

To move to a misspelled word, use `]s` and `[s`.

Suggest a list of alternatives : `z=`.

## Encoding

Set file to UTF8:

    :set fileencoding=utf8
    :w myfilename
