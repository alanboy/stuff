## Option 2
Hi [name], my name is Alan. I'm a student at the University of Washington studying informatics. I'm currently working on a project and looking to get feedback on my designs on a platform that helps hiring managers do better software interviews.

### Before the interview ###


### During the interview ###

Hi [insert name]. Thank you for taking the time to talk with us. My name is Alan  and I work for a company called [Company Name].

Today, I will be showing you a prototype of our website and asking you to perform some
tasks to test the design. While you are performing the tasks, I’m going to try to not answer your questions. If you get stuck, try to see what you can do on your own. When you are done, I will be asking some questions.

I want to emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers and getting your most straightforward feedback is really important. The more honest you are about how you feel and answer, the better we can improve our product for you. Don’t worry about hurting our feelings with your answers.

As you work on the tasks, please try to think out loud and share how you feel about what you see. Do you have any questions before we begin?

Lasty, I will be recording this interview so we can look back on it later. The video will only be seen by the company's team and will not be shared with anyone else. Is that okay with you?

#### Tasks ####
Imagine you are a recruiter that just discovered the website. Using the website, see if you can do the following tasks:
  - Create an account
  - Create an assessment
  - Invite someone to take your assessment
  - Remove one of the problems you have added to the assessment
  - Close your assessment

#### Questions at the end ####
Thank you so much for meeting with me! That was really helpful. I will ask a couple questions now.
  * What did you like the most about the website?
  * What did you like the least?
  * How would you describe your overall experience?
  * Was there anything that was confusing?
  * Do you have any questions for me?
