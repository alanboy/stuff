mentorship is not about waiting.
mentor vs sponsor
coach vs manager

lot of responsibilities to do this.

====

how to find a mentor.
sponsorship vs mentorship.
mentor vs sponsor, not manager.
mentor 1:1 

"my own board" of directors.

stop thinking about mentors as something you get, 
thik of it as something you do.

its a relationship "date", chemistry - conection

===

Act as a dounding board at critical points trough your career.
Provides guicane on career managment 
Shares an insider perspective on the business
Makes introductions to key industry contacts
Helps you identify and avoid business pitfals and work through the challenges ahead
Acts as an advocate for you and your goals
Celebtrates your successes, helps you with your doubts, and supports you when you fail.


====

Identifying & engaging a mentor
Know your needs & be committed.


look someone within your network first. Find great mentors trough 
inspiring peopel you're already interacting and working with now.

Think about *level relativity* look for someone a few levels above you.
we need to have things in common.

successful mentees do all the work: setup call, agendas, do hoemwork, 



**First session:
Be clear, focused and responsible.
Don't ask: "will you be my mentor" right off the bat. Far too big
for the first meeting.
Rather, ask for an initial meeting, something informal, 
over coffee. Keep it less than an hr.
Even a 15 min. phone conversation would be great.
Be prepared.

**Evaluate the chemistry.
thank yo notes.

** follow up.

menthoring is organic. its healthy to let it grow 
like any other relationship

don't force this stuff.

safe & honorable relationship.


?Go bigger, cultivate your personal board.
Moder mentorhisp isnt about looking to just one person;
it's about cultivating a group of people.

having a series of diverse perspectives is what helps you succeed.

sponsorship vs mentorship
= Your manager is NOT your mentor or sponsor. They are a gatekeeper.
= Sponsor= inside the company
= Manage your boundaries, mentors and sponsors aren't coaches.
= Manage your career polaroids.
= Visibility is a strategy.
= You can ask someone to be yoiur mentor; this isn't the case for a sponsor.
But you can seek to build a sponsor relationship.

A sponsor is : "Hey I just sponsored you to the role of VP" you need to get it together.
