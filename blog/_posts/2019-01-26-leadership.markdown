# Leadership, team process and decision making

```
Performance = f(motivation * ability)

ability = [ knowledge, skills, aptitude ];
```

## Key elements on team effectiveness

- Participation
- Influence
- Conflict
 - Cognitive: rationale.
 - Affect: emotional, style, personal

A team culture will evolve wether we do something or not. What gets rewarded and what get punished will affect the culture.

The managers struggle the most with conflict resolution.

## Brainstorming

Effective brainstorming is achieved by

- Give the members time to think about the problem, and write down the solutions.
- Everybody must share an idea in a round robin fashion.

You'll get:

- Fluency
- Flexibility
- Originality

## Promotions

Learning a skill that you use in your current job is **training**.
Learning a skill that will allow you to go from job 1 to job 2, that's **development**.

What is the Peter Principle
The Peter Principle is an observation that the tendency in most organizational hierarchies, such as that of a corporation, is for every employee to rise in the hierarchy through promotion until they reach the levels of their respective incompetence.

## Leadership styles
* Coercive style "Do what I say", my way or the highway, bullying. Useful only in crisis.
* Authoritative style "states overall goal, gives people freedom to choose their own way" style "come with me", clear vision for people to follow, enthusiasm. Trust. The leader is providing the VISION, follow me! Consistently most effective In most situations.  Proposing solutions but after listening.
* Affiliative style "people come first", building team harmony, creating emotional bonds, relationship. Maintenance roles.
* Democratic style "Concensus, input, collective". Only when the people HAVE the expertise. When the leader is uncertain what to do. The most time consuming.
* Pacesetting style "High expectations" already high degrees of skill already exists. They will be able to keep up.
* Coaching style: "Helping others to performa at a hight level". Least frquently used. Long term oriented, time consuming.

"When you're up to your neck in alligators,
sometimes you forget that your mission is to 
drain the swamp."
```

Authoritative and Affiliative will cover the largest range of situations.
