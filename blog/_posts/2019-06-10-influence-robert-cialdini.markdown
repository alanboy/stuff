The principlles - consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.

## Weapons of influence

If a chick makes the "cheep-cheep" noise, its mother will care or it; if not, the mother will ignore or sometimes kill.

How ridiculous a female turkey seems under these circumstances: She will embrace a natural enemy just because it goes "Chee-cheep", and she will mistreat or murser one of her own chichks just because it does not. She looks like an automaton whose maternal instincts are under the automatic control of a that single sound.

There is a quick in the system. It is not the rival male as a whole that is the trigger; it is some specific feature of him, the trigger feature.

We too, have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually wokr to our advancte, the trigger features that actiavate them can be used to dupe us into playint them at the wron times.(3)

Harvard social psycologyst [Ellen Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Langer), experiment with the Xerox machine. It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but the the first one, "because," that made the differnce.

"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?"

The result was that once again nearly all (93%) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance. 

There is agroup of organisms, often termed mimics, that copy the trigger features of other animals in an attempt to trick these animals into mistakenly playing the right behaviour tapes at the wrong times. The mimic will then exploit this altogether inappropiate action for itw own benefit.

**Contrast**
Simply put, if the second item is fairly different form the first, we will tend to see it as more different than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a heavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if we had lifted it without first trying the light one.

It is much more profitable for a salespoeple to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to dos will lose the influce of contrast principle, to fail to do will also cause the principle to work actively against them.

## Reciprocation

I know of no better illustration of how reciprocal obligations can reach long and powerfully into the future than the perplexing story of five thousand dollrs of relief aid that was sent in 1985 between Mexico and the improverished people of Ethiopia. In 1985 Ethiopia could justly lay claim to the greatest suffering and privation in the world. Its economy was in ruin. Its food supply had been ravaged by years of drought and internal war. Its inhabitants were dying by the thousands from disease and starvation. under these curcumstances, I woule not have been surprised to learn of a five-thousand-dollar relif doration from Mexico to that wernchingly needy contry. I remember my chin hitting my chest, though, when a brief newspaper item I was reading insisten that the aid had gone inte opposite direction> Native officials of the Ehtiopiian Red Cross had decided to send the money to help the victims of that year's earthquackes in Mexico City.

The anwer he recieved offers eloquen validation of the recipriocity rule: Desipite the enorumous needs prevailing in Ethipia, the money was being send because Mexico had sent aid to Ethiopioa in 1935, when it was invaded by Italy.

During the 1992 presidential election primary campaign, acress Sally Kellerman was asked why she was lending her name efforts to the candidadcy of Demotractive hoepeful Jerry Brown. Her reply : "Twenty years ago, I asked ten friends to help me move. He was the only one who showed up."

A highly effective variation on this marketing procedure is illustrated in the case, cited by Vavne Packard in _the hidden persuaders_ of the Indiana supermarket operator who sold an astoiunding, one thousand pounds of chesse in a few hours on eday by putting out the cheese and inviting customers to cut off slivers for themselves as free samples.

For this reason alone, then, we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological burden of debt.

"After learning the hard way, I no longer let a guy I meet in a club buy my drinks because I don't want either of us to feel that I am obligated sexually". Research suggests that there is a basis for her concern. If, instead of paying for them herself, a woman allows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both men and women) as more sexually available to him.

It was a classic example of how a weapon of automatic influece can infuse a compliance request with its power. I had been moved to buy something not because of any favorable feelings toward the item, but because the purchase request had been presented in a way that drew force from the reciprocity rule.


... the great majority refused : 83%. Yet, we obtained very different results from a smiliar sample of college students who were asked the very same question with one difference. Before we invite them to server as unpaid chaperons on the zoo trip, we asked them for an ever larger favor- to spend two hours per week as a conselor to a juvenile delinquent for aminimimm of two years. It was only after they refused this extreme request, as all did, that we made the smaller, zoo trip request. By presenting the zoo trip as a retreteat from our initial request, our success rate increates dramatically. Three times as many of the sutendts approached in theis manner volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons.

This is true only up to a poing, howver. Research concluded at Var-Ilan University in Israel on the rejection-the-retreat technique shows that if the first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic backfires. Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistinc initial position is not viewed as genuine concession and thus is not reciprocated. Hte truly figed negotiator, then, is one whoe initial position is exaggerated enough to allow for a series of recirprocal concessions that will yeild a desirsable final offer from the oponent, yet is not so outlandish as to be seen as illeigitimate from the start. 

The requester's concession withthin the technique not only causes targets to say yes more often, it also causes them to feel more responsible for having "dictated" the final agreemennt. 

It appears that an agreement that has been forged through the concessions of one's opponent is quite satisfying.

## Commitment and consistency

Once we have made a choice ot taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistenly with that commietment. Theose pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decisions.

A quote attributed to the great British chemist Michael Faraday suggests the extent to which being consisten is approved- sometimes more than being right. When asked after a lecture if he meant to imply that a hated acadaemic rival was always wrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, "He's not that consistent".

Certainly, then, good personal consistency is higly value inour culture. 

Once we have made up our mind about an issue, stubborns consistency allows us a very appealing luxury: We really don't have to think hard about the issue anumore. We don't have to sift through the blizzard of information we encouter every day to indentify relevant facts; we don't have to expend the mental energy to weigh the pros and cons; we don't have to make any further tough decisions. Instead, all we have to do when confronted with the issue is to turn on our consistency tape.

The boot camp. "There is no ex-Marine of my acquaintance, regardless of what direction he may have taken spiritually or politically after those callow gung-ho days, who does not view the training as crucible out of which he emerged in some way more resilient, simply braver and better for the wear".

All this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truyly to believe in. Such presssures will probaly produce temprary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continut to perform the desired behaviour when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsability for the actions we want them to take.

## Social proof

Experiments have found that the use of canned merriment caues an audence to laugh and more often when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funneri.

The problem comes when we begin responding to social proof in such a mindelss and reflexive fashion that we can be fooled by partional or fake evidence.

Our tendency to assume that an action is more correct if others are doing it is exploited in a variety of settings. 

Adverstires love to inform us when a product is the "fastest-growing" or "largest-selling" because they dont have to convince us directly that the roduct is good, they need only say that many other this so, which seems proof enough.

Sales and motivation consultant Cavett Robert catpures the principle nicely in his advice to sales trainees: "Since 95 percent of the poeple are imitators and only 5 percent initiatios, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than  by any proof we can offfer"

An imporant practical discovery was made in a second study of children who were exceptionally afraid of dogs: To reduce their fears, it was not necessary to provide live demonstrations of another child playing with a dog; film clips had the same effect. And the most effective type of clips were those depicting not one but a variety of other children interacting with their other dogs.

In their first experiment, a New York college student who appeared to be having an aeplileptic seizure received help 85 percent of th time when there was a single bystander present but only 31 percent of the time with five bystanders present. With almost all the single bystanders helping, it becomes difficult to argue that ours is the "Cold society" where no one cares for suffering others. 

When it was clear that the man was hust and requried assistance, he was helped 100 percent of the time in two of the experiments,.

The situation become very different when , as in many cases, bystanders cannot be sure that the event they are witnessing is an emergency. Then a victtim is much more likely to be helped by a lone bystande than by a group, specially if the people in the group are stragners to one another. 

Because we like to look poised and sophisticated in public and because we are unfaimilar with the reactions of those we don not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read expressions of concern when in a grouping of strangers. Therefore, a possible emergency becomes viewed as non-emergency, and the victim suffers.

## Authority

## Scarcity

A famous experiment of supply and demand on product ratings gave to 200 undergrads a jar with 2 cookies and a jar with 10 cookies.

Since that encounter with the scarcity principle - that opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited-
