## Keynote speaker (CVP Phil Sorgen - Microsoft)
US enterprise sales. National Industry
The future of modern managemenet. Managing trough transformation . Masive transofrmation changes.
To be competitive organizations need to transform
Thesis:

* Mission and Purpose: mission and purpose is at organizational level. managers do need to undesratnd and
        mission hasnt changed (aspirational, not time bound)
        satya did not change the mssions - what would the world look like if microsoft did not exist

        Are we consisten in our image.
        Solution Areas: We don't sell the 6 pillars ((infrastucture) we sell solutions.

        Management brings to life the most. Everybody has to believe

        Satya: Pace of change.

        45 days after he became CEO. Strong message to all employees, five years ago, 45 days msft released Office for ios.

* Cultural Change
        "Culture eats strategy for breakfast" -Peter D.
        They all though Satya would come and focus on engineering. Satya brought the pillar with the culture.
        Every microsfot employee has read : "Growth mindset" book
        Fixed mindset
            * Leads to a desire to look smart
            * Avoiding challenges, seeing failure as a bad outcome
        Growth Mindset
            * Leads to a desire to learn
            * Embraching challenges, seeing failure as essenteial to mastery

        GReat leadership creates an environment for dialog, for idea generation, for challengin perspectives. Be a part of an organization that organization. Be a fighter for growth mindset.

        From: know-it-all to:learn-it-all

* Managers as Change Agents
        Have to undrstand and believe the best voices regularly.
        - Provide clarity.
        - Generate energy.
        - Drive results

        Managers as coaches.

        Change and transformation. difference.

        great leaders bring a
        participation.

        how do we fight for growth mindset with people that arent fond of change.?
            i've seen leaders that transform OTHER teams (not teams they manage)
            Lighting the road ahead. show what success can look like.
            Its a DILMENA!!!

        Confidence in ideas: management system, confident in the right thing. how do we measure success = management system

        sales = art and science

        the job of the manager is brin everybody in. inclusivity is the most important thing. everybody in your team.

        if you build yoru team that is similar, and everybody is the same, and same as you.... no diversity... NO!
        there is nothing more diminish to growth than THAT!!!

        "DONT CALL IN THE INTROVERS", thats the worst thing you can do.
        "DONT CALL IN THE INTROVERS"

        If somebody talks to much: Don't cut their wings in front of everybody.!! Find a respectful way of letting them know.

        BY HAVING A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: Scorecard, KPIs, Mature SLA.

Urgency Point: SPEED
    5 year dimension:
    10 years ago: Big ate small, today and in the future Fast eats big. In this environment. Always disrupting, always changing.

This is HUGE !!!!

When you think about the future of people, what comes to mind? What is the future challenge...
    We need to an era where we can embrace technology.
    Challenge is to unleash, predict future needs,
    Unleashing potential
    How are you developing and retain as leader and manager
    Collaborative leadership.

Culture changes:
    Amazon: how do you maintain culture/changes: operate like a bunch of little startups.. choose a culture that aligns to you.
            amazon has leadership principles. what are they?
            the customer is always going to be dissatisfied, employees will always want more simplication of choice.
            experinces employes are having.

    Resourceful:
            11 years in operation. (when did she graduate)
            dynamic collaboration
            leadership
            shared commitment (us and clients)
            write guard-rails, vlaues, for yourself or company.

    Boeing:
            Rewarding leaders that do value diveristy and inclusion.
            A Personal board of directors.

    Authenticity:
            Invidudual leaders, self awareness.
            TOOL: "Hidden commitments" read it!
            What are my hidden commitments? How we want to walk in the world.

    The power of vulnerability, authenticity, TED TALK. Watch.
    https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability

    Managing and training people: only 1 direct report!!!

    My questions:
        what are the leadership principles

        WHAT ARE SOME OF THE METRICS YOU USE TO MEASURE THE HEALTH OF GEOGRAPHICALLY AND CULTURALY DIVERSE TEAMS?

            use of 1:1... one 1:1 a month( or quarter ?) what this employee needs to do to get to the next level.

            how do you measure core values? And make sure you are on track.

            ERG!!!!! Have a employee resource group1!!!! Boing has them! Microsoft has them.

            At amazon: Question we ask every day.... WOW !!!!!
                        How is your manager helping you...
                        What is the most difficult that gest in the way of you bien productive.
                        If there is somethig that could help your.

                If you can measure the speed at which you can hire. trends in hiring speed.
                has some good data. a certain site, if you cant hire deeper.
                change processes.

                The clients want feedback about (i dont know, you are asking something that might making them
                    BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO with the DATA

                Do you have the tools you need get the job done.

                period engagements are good but they come over time.


            sending docuemnts in advance
            times of the call...
            small tricks.
            being curious about the cultures of those.


Bring your authentic self to the job. Share a video with lady in blue. Share Donna Sarkar.

Tactical advice:

* Gain as many experiences as you can. Take the train and run towards your greatest fears.
* Be yourself. Don't let anyone change who you are. Holistic self. Who are you ?
* Think about what you are modeling.
    -> Cried in a professional setting and she apologized.
    -> This lady came up to her and said that she admired her, seeing here crying told her that it was ok and that maybe she could cry too.
    -> But when she apologized she took away all of that. There was no need to apologize.

Add humanaization for all jobs you perform.

President = owns the company

importance of operations vs other business functions:
The old model big will beat small.
Fast an agile will beat big and slow everyday.

Every company is a data company now, the companies that win start to understand the data. and start making recommendations on change. Prioritize what moves you make... not burning the company with change.

How much i want to change and how much can the company acommodate change.

Supply chain management.

At facebook all data is available except HR and customer data. An employee can query data openly and write queries.

Take aways:

        network, leadership skills. If it does not work, move back. It's ok.

    - Find a company you are passionate about. Aspirational. Feel connected. (Industry or company)
    - When interviewing. Make sure that the person you work for ... 80%
    - You are the average of the 5 people you surround youself with.... make sure you surround yourself with people ...

Consulting vs Agency world.

    Look at the exact same data, but see it in different ways.
    Because we are from the outside, we feel more free tpo say things, that
    people internally are not compelled to do.

    Sometimes customers want to understand what other companies are doing. Retail. How are they doing
    with customer experience, etc... problems of different ...

    there are trends but at different time periods, for example, we can learn what
    expedia (it ...) from hotels ...
        experida <-> hotels
        uber delivery <-> food
    the same way foods are being "detach" from customers with food delivery companies.

    Advice:
    Need to have the ability to navigate ambiguity. Tackle the problem. Case questions are interviews?
    Take something yo know nothing about and solve a problem.

    agile is big today.

    100 case interviews... what is a case interview?

    what is the business objective? ask from the beginning.

    How do you use experience from extenral client to improve internal...

Read about neuro science. Fear change.

when you setup the mindset to create a new mindset... is it a long term vision or short term?
at the beginning was ..
    first thinkgs is to go to exports, domestic abuse, violence,

    zero capital from venture capital.
    not having that type of money, gives you freedom. we dont start any venture if its a problem at the us level.
